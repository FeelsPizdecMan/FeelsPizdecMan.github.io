Then, the stand was taken by securities of metallurgic and oil companies, weapons manufacturers and gold miners. But it is a thing of the past. Our century is the epoch of the Internet and innovative technologies.<\/p><p>For the first time, the industry attracted immense attention in 1995. It began with a rapid growth of stock prices of Internet companies. Nobody understood anything, but it wasn't necessary. The sector went on growing. People believed that the global web would be able to change the established fitness of things completely. And lager sums of money were invested in these stocks. It ran to the absurd. Start-up companies with names containing the word \"Internet\" immediately attracted millions of dollars without a product, sales and profits. It's a common knowledge that the bubble burst in 2000. The scenario was not different from what usually happens at the bubble peak. Everyone who wanted to purchase stocks of this sector had already done it. There simply was no one to buy. However, investors began asking why lossmaking companies cost hundreds of millions of dollars.<\/p><p>The stock prices of the Internet companies collapsed and half of them went bankrupt. All this resulted in investors’ attention being deterred from this sector for several years. But as you know the history spirals on. And today the sector is extremely popular with investors from all over the world again. We see the corporations like Google and Alibaba easily making huge profits, and their stock price growing steadily.<\/p><p>Why the stocks of this sector are worth buying?<\/p><p>1. Innovative and Internet companies possess immense growth potential. The case is that on our planet, there is a large number of remote corners still not reached by the World Web. These very countries will be the tasty morsel for the companies to fight for, which will become a booster for their financial performance growth.<\/p><p>2. The corporations of this sector have enormous financial resources that they allocate in new products development: the companies dealing in the Internet technologies invest in completely non-core areas. This fact contributes to the companies efficiently developing innovations that we couldn't even think of before. For example, a well-known search engine Google develops unmanned vehicles. And Alibaba, which is engaged in the online retail development, invests in financial services. Such diversification can produce a positive effect on their financial performance and the corporations' quotes.<\/p><p>It's worth noting that both the car manufacturing and banking sectors are extremely conservative. While modern Internet giants take decisions far faster and keep moving forward. This is the reason why their revenues growth rates may accelerate in the years to come.<\/p><p>Let’s take a closer look at some of these companies:<\/p><p>1. <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shares\/FB.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Facebook&nbsp;<\/a>is the world’s largest social network. It was not the first to appear but turned out to be the best, the fastest growing and the most large-scale social network in the world. Its main competitive advantage is that it’s simply unclear, how one can create another such enormous network. After all, everyone has been on FB for a long time. And no one is going to leave for somewhere else.<\/p><p>For many years, the company's main problem was a slow revenue growth, despite a rapid growth of the users' number. In the last couple of years, the situation has changed dramatically. The main income is generated by advertising, which is located on the social network pages with increasing frequency. The company continues investing in innovations, acquiring dozens of start-ups that possess promising technologies. Then, it quickly brings them to the market under their own brand.<\/p><p>All these factors allowed investors to reconsider their opinion regarding the future of Facebook.<\/p><p>2. <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shares\/GOOG.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Google<\/a>&nbsp;is the most recognizable search engine. Google reigns in almost every country in the world. Today, it’s the most innovative corporation in the world together with Apple.<\/p><p>After having earned huge sums of money on advertising, the company proceeded to other sectors by buying up developments, teams, and patents. Currently, it owns the most popular Internet browser Chrome, Android operating system, and Google Maps cartographic service. As well as hundreds of other no less well-known and profitable developments.<\/p><p>Are there any reasons to expect a growth slowdown? More likely not. The company is at the forefront of innovative technologies that are changing our world for the better.<\/p><p>3. <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shares\/EBAY.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">eBay<\/a>&nbsp;– the world’s number 1 online auction. The history of eBay is the story of 20 years of success. The company was proceeding by touch through a completely unknown area, opening new horizons and setting its own rules.<\/p><p>Its founders were among the first ones in the world to understand that in the Internet era it’s not necessary to produce or sell anything. One can simply create a platform (in fact, it’s a shop window) where manufacturers and stores will display their products and meet their buyers. And eBay receives a fee both from every lot placed, and from every sale completed. Thanks to this online auction, millions of people around the world have got the opportunity to sell piece goods.<\/p><p>The company is growing steadily. Its audience exceeds 160 million users. And the generated profit makes it possible to invest in third-party services.<\/p><p>The whole sector of the Internet and innovation is the most promising investment option.<\/p>"},"37":{"id":37,"title":"Car manufacturers","text":"<p>The USA is considered to be the cradle of car manufacturing.

The famous enterprises of Detroit \"Big Three\" include Ford (present on the market since 1890), General Motors Corporation, which produces cars of Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, GMC, Vauxhall, and Opel brands (operates since 1908). In 1925, Chrysler Group LLC penetrated the market, which now manufactures Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram Tracks, SRT, and Morar.<\/p><p>All the car manufacturers experienced ups after the world wars and downs during the Great Depression and other crises. However, they were able to overcome these tests with dignity: General Motors and Ford Motor Co. remained independent, and Chrysler Group LLC in 2014, got under 100% control of the Italian Fiat concern. At the same time, European and Asian manufacturers have only increased their capacities.&nbsp; The century-long market experience of the car manufacturing giants is not the only reason to buy their stocks. According to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers ranking, the USA ranks second in terms of the number of cars produced. The White House Council for Automotive Communities – the body that provides subsidies for developing one of the key American industries, is supporting the American automobile giants’ power.<\/p><p>Despite the fact that the American economic growth rate amounts to about 2%, investments in the motor vehicle brands' stocks can not only save your funds but increase them as well: the American car manufacturing market on average grows by 8% per year.<\/p><p>A new stage of development will be a forthcoming tightening of environmental standards. On the one hand, the struggle for reducing emissions will result in rising vehicle costs and decreasing sales of such giants as Ford and General Motors, but on the other – this is a green light for electric cars manufacturers that are extremely popular among European drivers and widely introduced in model ranges of most manufacturers.

At the conservatives’ disposal is Ford Motor Co., whose stock price decreased from $15.5 per security in January 2014 to $9.7 in August 2018, but the annual dividend yield is about 7%. Those, who don’t have heart attacks during every quotation drop and use it for getting profit, may be interested in General Motors Co stocks. For the last 3 years, quotations range between $30 and $46 per share.<\/p><p>An interesting option for long-term investments is Tesla Motors securities. Since 2013, the stock price has grown 3 times! This is not by accident: the policy of reducing the share of hydrocarbon fuel and this fuel consuming vehicles is adhered by the USA, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union, which means that demand for electric cars will grow.<\/p><p>Our store also offers stocks of European and Asian manufacturers, which are by no means inferior to American companies and often even exceed them in many terms.<\/p>"},"38":{"id":38,"title":"Financial giants","text":"<p>lmost all the major players in the banking sector have already recovered from the 2008 crisis. To a great extent, recently completed quantitative easing programs of the Central banks (the US Federal Reserve, the Central Bank of the EU, the Central Bank of Japan and others) contributed to it, which were aimed at the industry restoration, in particular, the banks' balance sheets were cleared of any toxic assets. After receiving support from the regulators, banking institutions began to make profit actively in traditional areas of investment banking (joint stock capital, derivatives, fixed income instruments, and others). The corporate and retail segments continued growing as well.<\/p><p>According to the IMF forecast, in 2018 and 2019, the world economic growth rate will be about 4%. Favorable economic environment, the introduction of innovative services, alterations in taxation and strengthening of the banking structure form long-term prospects for purchasing financial companies' stocks. Our experts take a close look at the large banks that have the best earning potential and the most probable profitable areas. This is the very information that we use to help our clients to make the most profitable and secure investments. In this case, security is based on the well-known principle of \"too big to fail\", since many banks are infrastructural for the corresponding countries. However, the complexity of analysis in this very case is related to the credit institutions' scale, as well as to the huge size of their investment portfolio.<\/p><p><b>Advantages of investing in stocks of commercial banks and the financial sector:<\/b><\/p><p>1. The banking sector is quite a reliable one. A company’s growth depends on its clients’ increasing well-being. And the richer clients become, along with the global economies’ growth, the more banks and financial companies earn. In recent years, the stock quotations of the banking sector companies demonstrate a relatively stable growth. This indicates that the industry as a whole has recovered and can be considered a positive signal for purchasing securities of the financial industry companies.<\/p><p>2. A bank’s stock price depends on its profits. The growing financial indicators result in simultaneously rising stock prices. And theoretically, the best banks will always be profitable. On the one hand, they get cheaper (if compared to small commercial banks) resources. For example, the interest rate on individuals’ and companies’ savings is lower due to unlimited trust. On the other hand, these banks have an opportunity to participate in the major projects that change our world.<\/p><p>3.<b> <\/b>After the 2008 crisis, the American authorities have performed a tremendous job in increasing the sustainability of the entire banking sector.<\/p>"},"39":{"id":39,"title":"Pharmaceutics and biotechnologies","text":"<p>Today, the volume of the global pharmaceutical market is about $1 trillion. The amount seems great? No, and no again! The market is growing and within the next 5 years, analysts forecast that it will double in size. And along with the market growth, the stock price of the companies operating in this sector will also increase.<\/p><p>Then, what is happening to the pharmaceutical industry? It is strongly influenced by the following trends:<\/p><p><b>Insurance medicine<\/b>. Every year, a person pays a substantial sum of money for medical insurance. Then, he gets to a hospital for any reason (fracture or stomach pain). Doctors know that his treatment will be fully compensated by an insurance company and don't scrimp on the patient. And the patient himself isn't definitely seeking it. In their turn, pharmaceutical companies, especially those operating on the American and European markets, have a direct interest in investing in innovative developments instead of producing cheap counterfeits<\/p><p><b>The rapid growth of the middle class in developing countries<\/b>. When a person has already solved the food and accommodation problems, he starts to think about health, life quality, and expectancy. And not just think, but pay. In fact, the huge Chinese, Indian and other Asian markets are still empty and are ready for rapid growth in the years to come. And as far as Africa is concerned, nothing has even started yet. This is a deferred demand that will be fulfilled within the next decades.<\/p><p><b> The future at the doorstep<\/b>. Now it looks like science fiction; however, in 15-20 years, it will become a reality. After the human genome will have finally be decoded, medicine will shift gear. Each of us will be able to order (not for free) exactly that medicine, which perfectly suits our genotype. How will this be implemented in practice? The simplest case. Do you often have a headache? No longer will you have to buy aspirin. For you personally, pills will be developed that, on the one hand, will treat a headache as quickly as possible, and on the other hand, will be the least damaging for your liver. In the future, the problem must disappear by itself. A doctor prescribes and a pharmaceutical company immediately produces the product you need. Critics will say that it's expensive. Of course! No one argues with that. But! People do not mind paying much to stay healthy as long as possible. Few people will cut corners on health if they have money. This will result in the even larger growth of the stock prices of this sector's companies.<\/p><h3>What should be kept in mind when investing in Pharmaceutics?<\/h3><p>Every year, hundreds of small companies that develop “breakthrough” drugs and medicines penetrate the American market. Very few of them do achieve success, and their stock price skyrockets by a factor of tens and hundreds. However, by far larger number of small companies of this sector achieves nothing and goes bankrupt.<\/p><p>Even for professional investors, it's extremely difficult to guess, which of the companies will become successful. Therefore, it's advisable to pay attention to the large corporations dealing in pharmaceutics and biotechnologies for many years on. A summary of the advantages of this solution:<\/p><p>• <b>The companies are profitable<\/b>. Their revenue and income keep growing. This is based on the drugs being manufactured and previously received licenses.<\/p><p>• <b>The companies have money to develop dozens of drugs<\/b>. It means that unlike small enterprises, they don’t put all eggs in one basket. And even if ten medicines fail, the eleventh development will over and above repay the costs and generate profit.<\/p><p>• <b>Companies have an opportunity to purchase successful start-ups<\/b>. Above we have mentioned that only a few of the new companies achieve success. And on the wave of success, they are often bought by large pharmaceutical corporations that can immediately increase production and further boost profits. <\/p><p><b>Such large and well-known American companies include <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shop\/PFE.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Pfizer<\/a>, <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shop\/GILD.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Gilead Sciences<\/a>, and <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shop\/JNJ.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Johnson &amp; Johnson<\/a>. Each of them increases profit regularly and has excellent prospects for the future.<\/b><\/p>"},"40":{"id":40,"title":"The heavy artillery","text":"<p>The global financial crisis in 2008 provoked a global repartition of the financial market. Only those manufacturing enterprises have overcome the devastating consequences of the recession that succeeded in performing timely and competent production modernization. Nowadays, the major players in the global market function thanks to investing in scientific developments that have boosted the speed and quality of the production process.<\/p><p>The uninterrupted operation of American enterprises helped the USA to regain the leading position in industrial development. American large industrial companies represent all the existing fields, specialized in producing mass and serial products. Nowadays, there is a sharp upturn in the US oil and gas industry: American oil companies set oil extraction records on a regular basis. Analysts say that in 2018, the growth rate of investments in the American gas sector reached an extreme of 96%.<\/p><p>The American aerospace and defense industries have also recovered from a lingering recession: in 2018, the products of these industries have contributed $865 billion to the US state budget. In general, in the USA employment of production capacity rose to 77.9% and resulted in the dynamic development of the manufacturing, engineering, and electronic industries.<\/p><p>Against the expectation of international experts, the economies of several EU countries (Germany, France, and Italy) demonstrate high growth rates as well. German industrial enterprises are boosting production volumes. A favorable business climate in Germany has influenced the successful development of the car manufacturing industry: in 2018, sales of diesel cars increased by a record-breaking 20%.<\/p><p>After a lingering decline, the French industrial sector demonstrates stable growth: French enterprises carry out large-scale projects in the car manufacturing, food, and agriculture fields. In Italy, the mining industry, production of electronic and mechanical equipment is recovering. Since early 2018, Italian GDP growth rate amounted to 0.9%.<\/p><p>Great Britain confirms its position as a strong industrial power as well: in the construction industry, production volume increased by 3.3% compared to the previous year. The Central statistical office reports that in the first half of 2018, the general volume of industrial production increased by 1.5% and continues to grow slowly.<\/p><p>The People's Republic of China demonstrates the rapid development of the economic sector as well. Heavy industries, such as energetics, electric engineering, metallurgy, and car manufacturing, build the face of modern China. In PRC, large industrial companies operating in these industries account for 50% of GDP.<\/p><p><b>The country of the rising sun is famous for its cutting-edge developments in the innovative technologies field. Japanese scientific achievements Japanese are being massively introduced into the national industry, increasing the speed and quality of resource production. In Japan, the car manufacturing industry is the most profitable and knowledge-intensive industrial sector: investments in the Japanese car sector are growing intensively. Other fields of the Japanese industrial sector are booming as well, which was previously predicted by analysts. Promising projects in the robotics and electronics fields attract an increasing number of foreign investors.<\/b><\/p>"},"42":{"id":42,"title":"Oil and Energy","text":"<p>Now, we will tell you why it’s worth for an individual to purchase oil and energy companies’ stocks.<\/p><p>It's important to understand that these stocks are extremely dependent on the \"black gold\" prices. It means that if today the oil price grows, almost all the securities of this sector's companies will also grow, and vice versa. Therefore, for a beginning investor, it makes sense to distribute funds between several different companies of the oil sector.<\/p><p>Any investor can purchase stocks of any global oil and energy company. For example, securities of Canadian, South American, European and Asian corporations are traded on the American and European stock exchanges.<\/p><p>Let’s have a look into several popular stocks of the sector:<\/p><p>1. <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shop\/XOM.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil (XOM)<\/a>. The largest American corporation in the oil and gas sector. A rich one and a half-century-long history, tremendous reserves, and the best management in the industry – all these factors contribute to the company's steady growth, even despite the oil price decline in 2014. The stable oil prices over the last years let us suggest that the company has favorable prospects for the future.<\/p><p>2. <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shop\/CVX.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Chevron Corporation (CVX)<\/a>. The second-largest American and the world’s number nine oil and gas corporation. It has a long history similar to Exxon Mobil. The company’s branches are located in more than 100 countries all over the world. They manufacture chemicals, fertilizers, and petrochemical products, as well as develop reserves of non-ferrous and ferrous metals.<\/p><p>The company is knowledge-intensive. For example, 40% of the world's oil refineries apply Chevron's technology for oil hydroprocessing. Since recently, this American corporation has been investing heavily in the development of alternative technologies. This makes shareholders feel confident about the future, even if the oil prices won't be able to recover quickly.<\/p><h3>How to make a long-term investment in the oil sector?<\/h3><p>It’s quite a risky idea to purchase stocks of a particular oil company for a long-term. The oil companies’ securities may depreciate significantly even in case of the growing oil market. Most of us remember a good example of the explosion on the oil platform that belonged to the British company <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shop\/BP.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">British Petroleum (BP)<\/a>, which occurred in 2010.<\/p><p>As a result, about 5 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, just 80 kilometers away from the United States. The oil company's stock price collapsed, and for a few years, the story was on everyone's lips. And the company continued to repay billions of fines.<\/p><p>Therefore, it’s advisable to consider purchasing a basket of oil stocks as a long-term investment. In this case, a failure of one of them (just like British Petroleum) can be balanced by a significant increase of another one (for example, if a deposit that a company develops turns out to be more fertile than expected).<\/p><p>The American market also provides an opportunity to “buy oil”. The instrument is called “Crude oil ETF” (Exchange Traded Funds). These are exchange-traded funds, whose shares are traded on a stock exchange as ordinary stocks. Without going into detail of the pricing process, we should note that other things being equal, the oil price rise results in the increasing ETF cost and vice versa. Any ETF can be purchased via our Freedom24 Trading Platform. Also, there are ETFs for decreasing oil or oil companies' price.<\/p><p>Energetics is the no less popular sector of the economy. Alternative energetics is an unconditional trend for the next decades. It's enough to say that developed countries aim at increasing its share to 15% as soon as by 2025. Let us imagine that nuclear power, oil, gas, and coal oppose the sun, wind and water energy.<\/p><p>Western countries allocate tremendous funds for developing alternative energy sources. The private sector takes no less active part in the process. As technology develops, the cost of solar panels, for example, keeps decreasing. At the same time, the price of electricity sold will only grow over the long term. In many countries, it is directly funded by the state as well.<\/p><p><b>Consequently, the stock quotation of companies dealing in the alternative energy development possesses an excellent growth potential. And with the implementation of breakthrough technologies, some of them will become new global leaders.<\/b><\/p>"},"36":{"id":36,"title":"The best technology companies","text":"<p>Not only experienced, but beginning investors as well are familiar with the history of American technology companies. The stories of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who started the business in garages, have many times become the basis for movie scenarios.

All the companies share several common traits: besides the common activity field, all of them are relatively young (the only one “old man” is <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shop\/INTC.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Intel<\/a>, founded in 1968) and are of interest for both conservative investors and for those who don’t tend to keep stocks for a long time.<\/p><p>All the flagships of the American technology industry are included in the Forbes’ 50 largest American companies and confidently keep their positions since 2003. The magazine’s experts assess companies on the basis of four indicators: revenue, profit, assets and market value; therefore, one can and should rely on the ranking data.<\/p><p>One can assess the prospects of the industry and advisability of purchasing stocks of American technology companies by using NASDAQ Composite index analysis. The index based on the digital companies’ stocks increased by almost 3000 points only within the past three years: from 5,000 to 8,000 points.<\/p><p>From September 2017 through August 2018, investments in technology companies’ stocks (based on the NASDAQ Composite index) demonstrated a result by far exceeding the level of deposit yield and amounted to about 25%. However, this is an average performance: successful investments would generate even higher income for investors.<\/p><p>Let’s consider the prospects of investing in individual companies’ stocks. For example, investing in the QUALCOMM stocks can make long-term investors nervous: since 2015, the stock price fluctuated five times, rising to a maximum of $69 and falling to $42. However, within half a year only the quotes regained the lost positions, which surely will be of interest for short- and medium-term investors, who aim at making a profit from the rate fluctuations.<\/p><p>Fans of short- and medium-term investments should take a closer look at <a href="https://en.freedom24.com/\&quot;http:\/\/\/shop\/VZ.US\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">Verizon<\/a> telecommunications company as well, whose policy resembles the policy of the Russian \"Rostelecom\". Verizon is an active participant in the mergers and acquisitions market, as well as aggressively opens up new areas of providing services, such as video marketing. These very actions allow the company to stay one step ahead of its competitors.<\/p><p>Those who want to play a long-term game will surely like Microsoft. From September 2015 through August 2018, the company's stock price rose by more than 100% without any sharp fluctuations.<\/p><p>Another beneficial object for long-term investments is the Intel company, whose securities have been traded on the stock exchange since 1978. Throughout this whole period, the stock price has been growing steadily. The stock price ranges from $29 to $57, which correlates with the dynamics of the entire industry.<\/p><p>To summarize, it should be noted that investment in technology companies' stocks is one of the most promising and interesting courses in portfolio formation. Development of 5G networks, augmented reality technologies and neural networks give grounds to claim that the growth of this field and new records of quoting indicators are yet to come. Dynamic development and strong competition open up fascinating prospects both for risk-prone investors and fans of long-term investments.<\/p>"},"41":{"id":41,"title":"Top retail brands","text":"<p>The American consumer sector is represented by about 500 companies that manufacture cars, furniture, clothes, produce and sell foodstuff, as well as manage the leading restaurant brands.

The company develops innovative cancer treatment methods intended to treat uveal melanoma, synovial sarcoma, and other cancers.

Malfunctioning of the chromatin regulatory system is a major cause of cancer, neurological disorders, and other serious diseases.<\/p><p>Foghorn Therapeutics are pioneers in the discovery and development of a new class of drugs that target genetically defined dependence in the chromatin regulatory system. All four of the company's products are at the preclinical stage of development. The flagship product, FHD-286 for uveal melanoma treatment, will enter stage 1 of clinical trials as early as Q4 2020. <\/p><p>To date, the company has received at least $134.50M from investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Klarman Family Foundation. The financial results are typical for a biopharma company at the early stages of drug development: there is no income, but there are also no serious losses.<\/p><p>Analysts predict that the global melanoma drug market will grow by about 7.80% per year from 2019 to 2023, the key driver being the prevalence of this cancer, especially among the elderly population.

An important advantage of Snowflake is that the infrastructure can be used for any cloud, which enables moving the data from, e.g., Google Cloud to Microsoft Azure.

For the first six months of 2020, the margin was at 61.60%. The company's net loss for the first six months of 2020 amounted to $171.30 million: less than in the same period for 2019, when it was at $177.20 million.<\/p><p>With the growing margin and lower losses, the company became more attractive to investors, which subsequently led to an IPO application. <\/p><p><b>Snowflake IPO Outlook and Target Market<\/b><\/p><p>The industry Snowflakes works in is incredibly promising.
