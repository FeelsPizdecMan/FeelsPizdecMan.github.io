            <summary> Does my dog ​​need a massage? </summary>

            <p> In the wake of the popularity of canine rehabilitation therapists and fitness training. Which, by the way, I also do.
              Here
              you need to see the first photo of Kusilda's ass. Like? Welkam)
              <br>
              <br>
              But now I'm not talking about that. And about massage.
              The useful functions of massage are well known.
              Relax muscles clogged after training, warm them up, relieve spasm, open capillaries, improve saturation
              tissues with oxygen, stimulate the work of the skin glands, lymph flow, and so on.
              <br>
              <br>
              But, as you know, everything is useful when appropriate. We do not try to eat soup with a hammer and hammer in nails with a spoon.
              Accordingly, massage also has its own field of application.
              1. For warming up before physical activity. There are no questions here. We kneaded some muscles, warmed them up - and
              the likelihood of injury during exercise is much lower.
              2. For a correct exit from the load. There are no questions here either. We do not let the muscles cool down quickly, we give
              them
              gently exit the operating mode, prevent sprains, relieve spasms, clamps, relieve pain
              and
              feeling of "numbness", dispersing lactic acid. And also we prevent myositis - muscle inflammation,
              which
              long and hard to treat.
              3. For therapeutic purposes. It is a frequently used tool in behavior correction, and in working with
              neuroses
              and reactive states it is irreplaceable.
              But there we do not work with the muscles that deeply, so there is no need to worry.
              <br>
              <br>
              Is there a need for regular professional massage for a dog that does not play sports and receives a minimum load?
              I mean, living in the city dog ​​mode?
              Let's look at picture 2. Here is the muscle structure. They are made up of fibers, fibers contract and
              stretch to provide movement. A fat layer lies on top of the muscle layer, we all remember this from
              school course in biology.
              What happens when we regularly deep massage untrained muscles?
              And what we call "marbled beef") See picture 3.
              We stimulate adipose tissue to grow into muscle tissue. Accordingly, the dog does not look fat, but
              fact
              her fat is evenly mixed with muscle tissue and:
              - takes oxygen from the muscles. See, what rosy one?
              - prevents muscle fibers from contracting and stretching as they should.
              <br>
              <br>
              To the touch, such a muscle is light, soft and "rich", with a slight squeeze, the fingers fall into it as in
              butter
              bun.
              <br>
              <br>
              Now look at a muscle that hasn't been exposed to this effect. This is the fourth picture. This is elk,
              Yes. While the cow was massaged, restricted in movement and fed with high-calorie food, the elk ran around
              forest and ate what he found, and then ran again.
              Take a look. This is pure muscle, look how dark it is, oxygenated, look how much there is
              fat. Feel the difference.
              This is what people do when they give their dog a regular massage without training.
              By the way, training without massage is also not good. There will be injuries. Everything is good in its place. </p>

            <summary> Does the dog need salt? </summary>

            <p> When feeding dogs raw natural food, the question of the need for salt supplementation is often raised. let's
              let's figure this out. <br> <br>
              On the one hand, no one salt food for dogs in nature and they do not go to licks, unlike herbivores. FROM
              on the other hand, carnivores eat their prey whole, and these are mainly small rodents, receiving organs and
              blood. The salty taste of blood is due to NaCl or table salt. Thus, some amount of salt they
              receive. <br> <br>
              Salt is composed of two elements, sodium and chlorine. Na + yones are directly involved in the conduction of nerve
              impulses
              and other biochemical reactions. Sodium helps to maintain osmotic pressure in cells,
              participates
              in the transport of amino acids, glucose, organic and inorganic particles through cell membranes. When
              lack of sodium poorly absorbed calcium, moreover, it is removed from the bones and enters the blood. One
              of
              the reasons for the development of rickets-like conditions are the lack of salt in the diet. Chlorine is also essential for animals.
              For example, it participates in the formation of hydrochloric acid, the main component of gastric juice.
              How is blood distributed in the body of the prey? The bloodstream (vessels) contains about 56% of all blood. Part
              blood does not participate in the general blood flow and is deposited in the liver 20%, in the spleen - 16% and in the subcutaneous
              fiber
              contains up to 10% of the total blood volume. From the depot, blood enters the general bloodstream only when certain
              conditions. In part, the need for blood and the salt dissolved in it can be covered by giving these organs their
              dog. But there remains “not received” blood from the victim's body. And before going on sale the carcass
              bleeds, part of the blood leaves these organs and tissues. <br> <br>
              How much salt will a dog get by eating, say, a rabbit or a bird? This can be calculated by knowing the general
              the amount of blood in a potential prey. I found the following data: “The value of the average blood volume:
              horses
              9.8%, in cattle 8.2, small ruminants 8.2, greasy pigs 4.6, meat pigs
              type 7, chickens 8.5, rabbits 5.4, dogs 6.8, cats 5%. A person has a blood volume of about 7% of body weight ”. Those
              the average carcass of a conventional prey contains about 8% blood. Let our "catch" weigh 1 kg. Blood in her
              will contain 80 ml. The salt content in the blood is 0.9% (isotonic solution). So clean
              salt
              in such "production" contains 0.72 grams. At the same time, about 46% of blood is contained in organs (up to
              exsanguination
              carcasses). 0.38 grams remains in the blood. Thus, if a dog weighing 35 kg eats 1 kg of natural
              products imitating a conventional prey carcass, together with organs and subcutaneous tissue, it needs to be added
              0.5 g of salt per day, compensating for the lack of blood. If the dog does not eat organs (liver, spleen) he needs
              about 0.8 grams of salt per day. <br> <br>
              Salt intake is also not consistent for most dogs. There is production today - not tomorrow. That's why
              salt addition can be intermittent. It will not be superfluous to remind you that many products contain
              salt. For example, cottage cheese and other dairy products taste salty. Even vegetables contain salt, but in
              small quantities. Various delicacies, sauerkraut are also salty. This should be taken into account when
              adding
              salt to dog food. For example, an average herring with entrails (300 grams) contains about 10 grams of salt.
              A piece of herring, the size of 1/10 of a carcass without entrails and will contain about 0.5 grams of salt.
              In practice, you can compensate for the lack of salt by lightly adding food. What should be the salinity
              define
              quite simply - the same salinity as blood or isotonic sodium chloride 0.9% solution. If in
              Since the diet has organs, the dog needs slightly less salt. If the dog regularly receives
              a piece of herring or sauerkraut washed from excess salt, feeds on animal carcasses, receives blood,
              then
              there is no need to add salt to food. A great way to offer salt to your dog, but not
              overdo,
              is to put two bowls of water - one with the usual fresh, the other with slightly salted (approximately
              nine
              g of salt per 1 liter of water). The dog will be able to choose which water to drink - salted or ordinary. Method
              fit
              only for dogs on natural raw food. "Dryers" get salt from feed. <br> <br>

            <summary> Dog overeat, symptoms </summary>

            <p> Determining overeating is not difficult, usually we see evidence of a crime: a torn bag of food, empty
              a bowl where meat has recently been or fish has been thawed. Or do you yourself know that you gave a lot of food, well, not
              resisted the beggars' eyes.
              <br> <br>
              And if you have several animals in the house, for example, a dog and a cat, then you may have observed a team
              work. When the cat throws sweets off the table, and the dog downstairs quickly swallows them.
              <br> <br>
              Now about the signs. An overeating dog has an enlarged belly, it can whine, breathe more often, search for a long time
              "comfortable spot. Thirst appears later, especially if you have eaten a lot of dry food. Sometimes vomiting occurs
              and / or diarrhea.
              <br> <br>
              In most cases, overeating is not harmful to a healthy dog ​​and symptoms resolve on their own.
              by
              yourself, without treatment. But there may be complications, we will talk about them below.
              <br> <br>
              What to do?
              Option one. The dog ate like a wolf from the famous cartoon, and there is no vomiting. In this case, you need
              organize calm, give pancreatin or creon, or another similar drug.
              The approximate dose of pancreatin for a medium-sized dog is 1-2 tablets of 250 mg, for a large dog 3-4
              pills.
              It is more convenient for a small dog or cat to give a few granules of Creon (by opening the capsule).
              Then wait for the food to digest naturally.
              In addition, the dog will want to drink after overeating, especially if it has eaten dry food. In this case, you need
              give clean warm water in small portions.
              Why warm? Cold water slows down digestion, so warm water is needed.
              On the Internet, it is often recommended to take a walk, and even better to run with the dog after overeating, but this is done
              not
              worth it.
              During physical activity, the muscles require more oxygen and nutrients, in this case
              the body will have to redistribute blood flow. But keep all systems running intensively at the same time
              not
              work out.
              Nature does not like waste, if you need to run, then you will have to temporarily slow down digestion or
              get rid of food completely to make it easier.
              You can not take my word for it, but check everything on yourself, try to eat a hearty meal and go to the gym,
              most likely you will vomit after the first approach.
              What will an intense run with your dog on a full stomach lead to? To increase the load on
              the cardiovascular system and, as a consequence, indigestion.
              And if you have a dog of medium or large size, especially over 4-5 years old, then running and jumping, even after
              normal feeding can lead to torsion of the stomach. In this case, you need to urgently perform an operation,
              otherwise the dog will die.
              Overfeed the dog, do not walk with it, let it lie and digest the food.
              <br> <br>
              Option two. The dog ate and vomited. In this case, you can do nothing except rest and a little
              starvation diet 8-12 hours. Then start feeding in small portions.
              <br> <br>
              Option three. The dog, soon after overeating, began to vilify, then we give a smecta or similar
              a drug.
              We also give preparations containing enzymes (pancreatin or analogs, the dose is higher).
              We do a starvation diet until the diarrhea stops. Here, with some reservations, you can starve for a long time (1-3
              days) only for an adult animal without chronic diseases (for example, diabetes). If there's
              diseases, then most likely you know about them.
              We make sure that the dog receives a sufficient amount of fluid, as with diarrhea, a lot is lost
              water
              and electrolytes. If he drinks little, then we eat forcibly, you can alternate clean water with rehydron or
              analogues.
              As a last resort, inject solutions subcutaneously.
              <br> <br>
              Dangerous symptoms
              When should you see a doctor?
              <br> <br>
              You see a rapid increase in the abdomen, literally before our eyes, the dog is trying to vomit, but vomiting without food,
              only mucus and saliva come out. Although you know there is food. The animal is worried, constantly moves from
              place in place, groans. Such symptoms are more often observed with torsion of the stomach.
              <br> <br>
              Vomiting and / or diarrhea often recurs and does not stop, despite hunger diet and application
              sorbents. Also in vomit or feces there are impurities: a lot of mucus, blood.
              <br> <br>
              Several days have passed after overeating, and the dog still has not gone to the toilet or has tried
              defecation,
              but no result. But this is on condition that there was no vomiting.
              <br> <br>
              Decrease or increase in temperature. On average, in a healthy dog, the temperature ranges from 37.5 to 39.5,
              there may be nuances depending on age and breed.
              <br> <br>
              Also, you should be alerted: depression, convulsions, rapid heavy breathing, which is long
              continues, loss of consciousness.
              <br> <br>
              Conclusion
              Overeating is not fatal, but it is dangerous, especially if the dog is elderly or has
              chronic diseases.
              <br> <br>
              Let me remind you a trivial thing - do not forget about prevention, pet feeding controls
              man.
              It is easier to prevent your dog from overeating than to try to help it later. </p>

            <p> Looking ahead, we will voice the conclusion: you should not feed domestic predators with one pulp, growing dogs and

              Cats need at least 10% of their daily intake of raw bones daily. Subject to

              of this

              simple rule, no hyperparathyroidism threatens them, although large breeds of dogs at the time of intense

              growth of 10% is not enough. But that's another topic)

              <br> <br>

              MYTHS OF VETERINARY - Rickets in dogs and cats.

              <br> <br>

              "Rickets in dogs and cats" - this is how our article could be called. However, an article with this title turned out

              would

              very short and would look like this:

              <br> <br>

              “Rickets in dogs and cats is not diagnosed, because in practice it does not occur, except in laboratories

              (within the framework of experiments, when special conditions are created for the development of a rickety state) ".

              Many pet owners may wonder, disbelieve, or decide

              get into an argument because you heard about rickets in pets, saw rickets in pets, read

              about rickets in pets or even found out about such a diagnosis from your pet from a veterinarian

              (who should update his knowledge).

              <br> <br>

              From the statement above, the question arises - what is it then, if not rickets? After all, the animals they put

              such

              diagnosis, are ill, they have symptoms of the disease.

              <br> <br>

              In addition, despite the tending to zero likelihood of rickets, people sometimes write to our blog: “Our

              kitten / puppy rickets, how can you help him? " And they are surprised at the answers of our veterinary specialists that

              they can't have rickets - it looks like it! One to one, as the doctor said, is written in a book or on the Internet.

              <br> <br>

              For this reason, and also due to the fact that while treating rickets, a real disease that with

              they confuse rickets - not to cure, we decided to write this article.

              Let's figure it out!

              The symptoms described by pet owners with "rickets" are approximately the same:

              <br> <br>

              - vocalization (meows, whines),

              - supporting ability worsens (up to the state when the kitten or puppy cannot walk),

              - there may be pathological fractures - this means that the fracture was obtained in conditions in which healthy

              the animal would not be harmed (for example, jumping off the couch or playing),

              <br> <br>

              - the limbs are "not like that", the animal leans on them incorrectly, often the owners say that the animal

              "Paws are crooked", there may be foot walking.

              <br> <br>

              For an ordinary person who is not familiar with medicine, this condition may indeed look similar to

              rickets, especially since it is observed in young animals, most often in kittens and puppies at the age of 3-4

              months. However, an ordinary person most often does not know what rickets is, he just remembered from childhood that

              "Rickety" is something so small and crooked.

              In cats and dogs, in most cases, rickets are confused with secondary (alimentary) hyperparathyroidism

              (much

              less often - a number of congenital abnormalities, both in metabolism and in the structure of the musculoskeletal system).

              <br> <br>

              How does rickets differ from secondary hyperparathyroidism, why should they not be confused and, all the more, considered "one and

              same"?

              <br> <br>

              Rickets is a pathology caused by a deficiency in the diet of provitamins of group D and a deficiency of ultraviolet radiation (or

              exposure to the sun, therefore, regions with low insolation are at risk, that is, those where there is little sun).

              Let us explain what this means.

              <br> <br>

              Vitamin D is responsible for the exchange of calcium and phosphorus, that is, in simple terms, for the state of bones in the body.

              <br> <br>

              Vitamin D is actually a collective name for a whole group of substances. In particular, there is

              ergocalciferol

              (vitamin D2), which is found in plants, and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), which is found in

              animals

              tissues. And he and the other perform almost the same functions in the body, and both can be synthesized

              in

              skin under the influence of sunlight (more precisely - under the influence of ultraviolet radiation) from the predecessors -

              ergosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol. At the same time, ergocalciferol is contained in more or less intelligible quantities

              in

              parsley and nettles, for example. In the more familiar vegetables that we eat more and more often, it is not enough. A

              Cholecalciferol is found mainly in some seafood, the famous fish oil and yolks. When

              this, its content in egg yolks is such that to obtain a sufficient daily dose, the conditional

              average

              a person would have to eat 20 yolks a day. Therefore, with food under normal conditions (without fish oil), we

              we practically do not get vitamin D, its main amounts are synthesized in the skin.

              Accordingly, in some animals and humans, with a deficiency of sunlight, calcium absorption is impaired and

              phosphorus. Vitamin D performs, relatively speaking, the function of a conductor - there is calcium, there are bones, it

              places

              the first to the second. And even with a sufficient amount of calcium in the diet, in the absence of a calcium conductor in

              bones will not come, it will just come out with feces. Of course, in fact, the mechanism is much more complicated, but

              simplified

              the model may well look like this. And if for adult people or adult animals such a problem is usually

              is almost invisible, then in children and young animals in whom the skeleton is formed and grows, this leads to

              rickets.

              This primarily affects the tubular bones - these are the bones of the limbs. During the growth period at the ends of the tubular

              bones have growth zones, due to which the bone grows in length. The growth period ends then

              when the growth zones are closed, they ossify. And it is these growth zones that violate their normal

              functioning with rickets - as a result, the bones are shortened, bent (or pathologically

              lengthen,

              depends on many additional factors).

              <br> <br>

              So, now about the most interesting. First, in cats and dogs exposed to sunlight, vitamin D

              is not produced. Absolutely. They definitely need to get it with food. Secondly, only vitamin is suitable for them.

              D3. And thirdly, oddly enough - despite this, they do not have vitamin D-dependent rickets. More precisely,

              he

              was recorded only in laboratory conditions, and even then not always. In practice, even with very strong

              deficit

              it did not develop rickets in kittens and puppies in the diet.

              <br> <br>

              Here's an interesting feature. However, this does not mean that they do not need vitamin D - they really need it, but

              its deficit will not lead to rickets.

              But what happens in kittens and puppies, and often happens - this is secondary hyperparathyroidism.

              <br> <br>

              Secondary (or alimentary, that is, nutritional) hyperparathyroidism is a pathology caused by

              a deficiency in the diet of kittens and puppies of calcium and an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus (when phosphorus

              much more than calcium - this is wrong). With an excess of phosphorus and a deficiency of calcium,

              parathyroid hormone. If we said about vitamin D that it is a conductor between calcium and bone, then parathyroid hormone -

              this, relatively speaking, governing this conductor :) When phosphorus becomes more than calcium,

              organism

              panics, this problem needs to be addressed - and more parathyroid hormone is produced, which leads to the fact that

              calcium

              from the bones it is washed back into the blood. Because maintaining a constant blood composition for the body

              more important,

              calcium is needed not only in the bones, and it is urgently taken from the depot - from the bone tissue. As a result, the

              bone density - such bones on x-ray look almost transparent, merging with soft tissues.

              This, firstly, is painful, because the periosteum is very rich in nerve endings, and secondly, it

              leads

              to pathological fractures. As a result of these two factors, the kitten or puppy in the early stages reduces

              activity, stops running and jumping, the same "wrong" gait appears, at later

              support ability disappears altogether.

              <br> <br>

              So, let's summarize. There is also a similarity in these two pathologies - vitamin D plays a role in secondary

              hyperparathyroidism, but primarily for the reason that diets leading to this problem

              (purely

              meat rations, meat purees such as Agusha or Tema, lean meat), practically do not contain vitamin D either.

              This is where the similarities end and the differences begin.

              <br> <br>

              What is the Difference Between Rickets and Secondary Hyperparathyroidism:

              <br> <br>

              The most important - rickets - can develop in humans and some farm animals, for example,

              calves. Kittens and puppies do not have it, but there is secondary hyperparathyroidism. In general, this could

              would

              finish the list of differences as our blog is about cats and dogs, but let's continue.

              <br> <br>

              Causes. Rickets - due to deficiency of vitamin D and sunlight. Secondary hyperparathyroidism - due to deficiency

              calcium and the wrong ratio of calcium to phosphorus.

              <br> <br>

              Manifestations. Rickets leads to disruption of growth zones, curvature of bones. Secondary hyperparathyroidism leads to

              decreased bone density, and indirectly to fractures. Curved bones and "transparent" (low

              density)

              bones are different.

              <br> <br>

              Treatment. With rickets, either vitamin D supplements or additional ultraviolet radiation are prescribed,

              sunbathing (but not at the same time, an excess of vitamin D is no better than a deficiency). With secondary

              hyperparathyroidism requires restoration of the normal calcium-phosphorus balance, restriction of mobility

              (so that until the bone density returns to normal, the animal does not develop fractures). In fact, of course,

              here, too, there is something in common - both there and there you need a balanced diet, of course, a supplement with calcium

              will significantly improve the problem with secondary hyperparathyroidism, but if the rest of the diet remains

              unbalanced - nothing good about it.

              <br> <br>

              Forecast. With rickets in animals, bone deformity is often irreversible, since treatment may be delayed.

              When

              timely start of treatment, the prognosis is favorable. With secondary hyperparathyroidism, the prognosis is favorable

              at

              absence of pathological fractures. If there were limb fractures, overall recovery is usually also

              going well enough, the worst prognosis is for a spinal fracture, although it will depend on

              places

              fracture and a number of additional factors.

              <br> <br>

              Conclusion!

              These are different pathologies. They require a different approach to treatment. Nevertheless, the Internet is replete with articles about

              "Rickets in cats and dogs." And the most dangerous thing is that if you hear from a veterinarian or read in

              on the Internet about rickets in his kitten or puppy, a person will begin to treat rickets in his pet, then

              such treatment will not help the animal in any way cope with secondary hyperparathyroidism, which it actually has

              there is. This means that the pet will continue to experience pain and remain at risk of breaking.

              spine just jumping off the couch.

              <br> <br>

              Often the confusion with these two diagnoses is due to the fact that the textbooks used to study in veterinary

              doctors in higher educational institutions are dedicated only to farm animals. In principle, for

              getting the education of a veterinarian, knowledge of cats and dogs in our country gives little, any

              veterinary medicine of unproductive animals requires self-education (attending and / or listening to lectures,

              seminars, conferences, webinars). But sometimes data from one area is transferred to another. Only cats and

              dogs are carnivores, but cows and horses are not, and the difference in approach to their diagnosis and treatment is huge.

              By the way, understand that the article about "rickets in cats and dogs" is written on the basis of data on agricultural

              animals, you can, for example, by the word "young", which is often found in such materials - which

              applied

              for calves and other children of agricultural animals, but for cats it sounds rather strange :)

              <br> <br>

              To justify a little veterinary specialists, I would like to note that sometimes doctors, when diagnosing

              alimentary hyperparathyroidism in kittens and puppies, they correctly understand the essence of the diagnosis and the problem, and are correct

              recommend

              treatment, mistaken only in the name, saying "rickets" instead of "secondary hyperparathyroidism". With this article we neither

              in

              In no case do we want to be hectic or whitewash ourselves at the expense of others. After all, the problem is not only that confusion

              diagnoses - illiterate, but also in the fact that pet owners have a habit of rechecking diagnoses in

              Internet and adjust the treatment yourself, according to the advice from the same place. Therefore, the doctor who called

              alimentary hyperparathyroidism rickets and who prescribed the correct treatment at the same time runs the risk of seeing on repeated

              receiving negative dynamics from his patient, as the owner "googled" rickets and treated rickets.

            <summary> Truth & Myths: Mixed Dog Food </summary>

 

            <p> Today I was asked to find an article on mixed diet for dogs and I ventured to write my opinion. how

              would

              we did not want to call this diet erroneous and harmful for dogs, 1/3 of the owners feed their

              animals

              it is mixed and therefore we must try to find out the whole truth about this controversial type of nutrition.

              <br> <br>

              As soon as we receive our first coveted packet of food, we immediately hear the opinion of doctors and sellers about the ban

              combination of natural products with ready-made industrial feed.

              <br> <br>

              However, many breeders raise their litters on a mixed diet, adding such

              foods like: curd, milk, eggs and raw beef scrap. World-renowned nurseries give in addition

              drying

              - raw meat, book, beef tripe and udder. Most owners add, in addition to drying, fresh vegetables,

              fruits and herbs. Many train dogs using meat, cheese, and oven-dried offal on-site.

              IN

              broad sense of understanding - we are all violators and adherents of mixed dog food)

              <br> <br>

 

              In my opinion, the myth about the inadmissibility of mixing drying and natural (as well as different types of drying) was invented

              dry food producers. With the aim of increasing sales. That is, "add" the user to their feed.

              <br> <br>

              Mixed Diet Dog Myths.

              <br> <br>

              Dry food is undoubtedly more convenient. And if a person is offered "either-or", he will choose what is easier for him ...

              <br> <br>

              Having tried natural, "drying" dogs are very reluctant to eat dull "expanded clay".

              <br> <br>

              The producers of dry feed themselves recommend MIXING canned food (of their own company, of course),

              if

              the dog eats drying badly - what is it if not MIXING drying with natural.

              <br> <br>

              Various, supposedly, enzymes for drying and natural. Rave! Here is amylase - for the breakdown of carbohydrates. Here is trypsin

              -

              for proteins. Lipase and bile. to-you for fats ... And there are NO separate enzymes for dry food and for wet food!

              <br> <br>

              Balance. Perfect balance is also a myth. You might think that pure natural is the perfect balance. Today buckwheat

              tomorrow millet ... Today beef, tomorrow chicken ... I generally keep quiet about vegetables - they vary greatly in

              season ... Again, no one weighed to the nearest gram - they poured everything on the eye ... AND FOR AGES, dogs

              grew up

              on this and nothing, lived ... and lived well and even worked). My deep IMHO - to a healthy dog ​​CONSTANT

              No PERFECT balance needed. If the balance is approximately observed averaged over a week, this is normal (well

              of course, you should not go to extremes, like today is naked porridge, and tomorrow is pure meat ...)

              <br> <br>

              But, the chemistry is the same there, but the physics is different.

              <br> <br>

              1. In drying, the nutrients are already half-digested, they require fewer enzymes to digest than

              natural woman.

              2. Natural water immediately goes "to work", and drying (DRY!) Must first lie in the stomach, swell,

              soak in gastric juice and water.

              <br> <br>

              Therefore, it is better for dogs on a mixed diet to spread the feeding time by drying and natural food as much as possible.

              AND

              it is also worth giving drying already soaked.

              <br> <br>

              In general, in my opinion, the ideal is natural, and drying is just like a lifesaver for the road, dacha, not

              managed to cook, etc.

              <br> <br>

              You can't feed the subbok mixed! Or is it possible?

              <br> <br>

              It is not permissible to feed dogs mixed, because for the digestion of dry food and natural food

              required

              different enzymes.

              I heard this learned phrase many times, but not a single doctor or dog owner could

              list the name of the "special" enzymes, which in general is not surprising - they simply do not exist!

              <br> <br>

              Everything is made up of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Proteins that feed and meat are broken down by pepsin and trypsin.

              The only difference is that proteins in the feed have a broken structure - they are denatured and hydrated, and their

              molecules and DNA are "straightened" and that is why their digestion is much faster, while

              how meat can be digested from 8 to 12 hours, hence the different times and the feeling of satiety. Similar

              lipase is released - for the breakdown of fats. Depending on the type of food entering the stomach, the dog has

              gastric juice changes in strength and acidity. Different types of feeding cause excellent food intake.

              acidity and volume of gastric juice, its composition changes depending on the type of food, so I don't understand

              those statements that the stomach "does not have time to get used to." In the same way, enzymes also change in composition

              pancreas and the amount of bile, depending on the type of food supplied.

              <br> <br>

              Mixed meals upset the balance of dry food.

              <br> <br>

              If you feed the dog in a mixed way, then we will upset the balance of the dry food and this will harm the dog's body.

              I also really wanted to believe in the fairy tale about the mythical balance of dry food - a kind of prototype of space

              food for dogs, but the more I delved into the essence and learned to understand the composition of the beach packs, the more

              convinced

              that this is the balance of "Doshirak" and "Rolton". Yes, good food contains expensive probiotics, vitamins and more

              quality meat. However, all feed lacks such components as: fresh vegetables, fruits,

              greens, dairy products and cottage cheese, fresh raw meat - easily digestible protein: quail eggs,

              flank, turkey, black tripe and sea fish. You just need to carefully read the composition and correlate

              the cost of feed with the price declared on the market (minus the costs of production, advertising, storage and

              implementation) to understand how much these products are lacking in the feed. There is another concern -

              an excess of vitamins. However, we forget about such a concept as the digestibility of ingredients and biological

              availability.

              <br> <br>

              An overabundance, as a rule, occurs only with the intake of artificial vitamins and microelements (more often

              fat-soluble), but in nature this is impossible - the body will take exactly as much as it needs,

              all

              other - it is excreted through the kidneys and liver without causing harm. Please note that it is dryers more often

              others suffer from such unpleasant vices as eating feces, a perverse appetite - eating earth,

              stones, hair ... picking up food from the ground. Usually when going to a natural diet or black scar management and

              raw meat. it all goes away.

 

              <br> <br>

 

 

              Dry and natural food must not be mixed in the same feeding.

 

              And this is absolutely true. Like any diet - mixed food has clear rules. In one bowl not

              permissible

              mix two such different types of food, you should not add chicken pieces, kefir, or crumble to the feed

              there meat. Mixed meals are not a snack on a pig farm. At least 7-8 should pass between meals.

              hours, and it will be most correct to use a dry ball in the morning (say, at workout) or at home, and

              in the evening - give raw meat with vegetables.

              <br> <br>

              Why is it important?

              <br> <br>

              Natural food differs in moisture content, it begins to be digested immediately, as soon as it gets into the stomach

              dogs. At the same time, it requires more enzymes, higher acidity and volume

              gastric juice and the time for the breakdown of proteins and fats. Dry food - has a very low percentage of moisture, it

              removed from the croquettes during dehydration and cannot start digesting right away - it needs time

              lie down and swell, soak in gastric juice - this takes at least 4-5 hours. What will happen

              if we mix natural and feed in one feeding. Drying will only begin to be moistened with gastric juice and will not

              having time

              digest properly - it will be released in transit, the natural woman will begin to wander, creating a favorable environment for

              development of pathogenic intestinal microflora. As a result, we have flatulence and disruption in the digestive tract.

              (gastrointestinal tract).

              <br> <br>

              Mixed meals are harmful to the pancreas.

              <br> <br>

              This statement is based on the fact that it takes more time to digest natural food and

              different composition of gastric juice. However, we forget that these indicators are not constant and depend on

              incoming food, each time adjusting to it - this is the law of evolution and survival. Enzymatic

              system

              recognizes familiar food and secretes the necessary enzymes, the composition also changes depending on the food

              acidity of gastric juice ...

              <br> <br>

              However, if the dog was not familiar with the taste of raw meat before, it should be introduced very gradually and smoothly,

              accustoming with small pieces of raw shaving. We increasingly meet breeds who did not know the taste from childhood.

              raw meat. They need help - give a course of enzymes (as prescribed by a doctor), probiotics, diluted

              apple cider vinegar for meat - for acidification of gastric juice. I am convinced that any dog ​​can learn

              to digest raw meat and should be familiar with it, because it is the basis of the species-specific diet of dogs.

              <br> <br>

              When is it worth switching to mixed feeding?

              <br> <br>

              As with any diet, mixed food has its pros and cons and is not suitable for every dog.

              <br> <br>

              Why do they resort to mixed meals:

              <br> <br>

              - Raising puppies and raising litter in nurseries (cottage cheese, dairy products are added to the diet,

              beef shank, book, tripe and udder). The goal is to diversify the diet and prepare the dog's gastrointestinal tract for different

              types of food, because the owner does not know what the future owners will feed the dog.

              <br> <br>

              - Natural products are necessary for full nutrition of a puppy bitch and stud dog before mating.

              <br> <br>

              - EU, working dogs - Husky, Laiki ... - they need raw fish in their diet.

              <br> <br>

              - Raising puppies of large breeds, as well as working guard and hunting breeds - in their diet is necessary

              higher protein and the presence of natural, easily digestible animal protein. They are given flank, beef,

              heart, liver.

              <br> <br>

              - Supplementing the diet in the form of natural delicacies - cheese, dried lungs, vegetables, fruits and herbs.

              <br> <br>

              - This is the salvation of little ones and fussy who choose meat from a side dish in the form of cereals or vegetables. As well as good

              help at the dacha and on a long trip, where you do not want to spend a lot of energy on cooking, say, with natural

              diet.

              <br> <br>

              - Many people feed straight, but drying is freely available during the day (it is practiced in small dogs).

              <br> <br>

              - Raw meat is essential for working and sporting dogs during periods of increased stress.

              <br> <br>

              What to add to dry food?

              <br> <br>

              Actually what is lacking there - fresh vegetables, fruits, berries, cottage cheese, quail eggs, raw

              meat, tripe, liver, sea fish .. I see no point in adding cereals and porridge to drying, there are already grains and

              ballast fillers about 70-80%.

              <br> <br>

              Which food is suitable for a mixed diet?

              <br> <br>

              For this type of food, it is necessary to take food with the shortest and simplest composition as a basis, so that

              he was not overloaded in proteins and fats, as well as vitamins and a set of medicinal herbs .. That is, most

              holistic people such as "Akana", "Origen", "Wolfsblat", "Grandorf" - will not work, they do not take meat well

              and

              there is a danger of protein poisoning. It is worth choosing food "simpler" - like "Bosch", "Happy Dog", "Brit

              Kare ",

              "Bozita", "Nero Gold", "NAU", "GOU" (whole grain) .. with moderate protein and fat or even lightweight

              feed with one type of protein and a ratio of 22-24 \ 13-14 and no higher.

              <br> <br>

              Feeding scheme for mixed meals.

              <br> <br>

              There are several feeding patterns. Most Acceptable and Beneficial for Most Dogs - Introduction

              "natural

              days "2-3 times a week. Breeders of large breeds also recommend replacing 2

              feeding from 5 - natural products. For an older puppy - 50/50% mixed food is recommended

              or

              75 \ 25%, where the first number means dry food offered to the dog in the morning feeding, and the second number means

              means longer digestible raw meat with vegetables for evening feeding. Surprisingly enough

              highly

              many dogs adhere to this rule and happily live to old age.

              <br> <br>

              If mixed feeding is prohibited by a veterinarian or breeder.

              <br> <br>

              The opinion of doctors about mixed feeding is ambiguous and is influenced by dry food marketers.

              Suffice it to say that this is a common practice in Europe. They calmly use meat in the diet or

              switch to drying on the road and long trips. They also never make sure that food and canned food are

              a single brand and change the feed firm regularly - once every 3 months. As you can see, many taboos exist only in

              our

              heads. When the food first appeared, doctors recommended to continue giving meat in separate doses, later

              they changed their minds, perhaps advertising and student training based on well-known brands played a role here

              feed. Now a good doctor treats the diet very individually and indicates only the need

              monitor the condition of the animal - tolerance, yield, lack of allergies and indicates

              necessity

              get tested regularly. If everything - from the exit and ending with biochemistry and blood tests - is normal,

              then feed mixed for health. And only a few doctors in the old fashioned way shove us a packet of RK and Hills and

              frighten with heavenly punishments if we decide to give the dog meat.

              <br> <br>

              There are no universal patterns that fit all dogs, just like no two organisms are alike.

              <br> <br>

              Some dogs like mixed food, others do not - you need to focus only on individual

              features of the body. If you are tested and everything is in order, if your dog is right

              this

              type of feeding, the dog feels good on it and looks great (and no one can do it better than you

              evaluate, except for biochemistry), then stay on a mixed diet - do not listen to anyone. Understand that and

              It is beneficial for marketers to convince that the only correct feeding is feeding with dry food. There are

              respected doctors, and experienced breeders who feed their dogs mixed. Yes, go from extreme to

              the extreme is not worth it, but still, I repeat, if the tests are normal, then why look for the cause of what is not and

              invent non-existent danger and future diseases. Many dogs eat mixed food until old age.

              and

              analyzes - even into space!

              <br> <br>

              Is mixed food suitable for all dogs?

              <br> <br>

              First of all, mixed food is suitable exclusively for HEALTHY animals. It may fatally fail

              dogs with gastrointestinal and liver problems, diseases of the pancreas and ICD. Do not translate abruptly into it

              drier who did not know the taste of raw meat before, elderly animal, dogs belonging to mini-breeds

              (

              especially artificially bred). Mixed meals are best suited for dog breeds such as: BUT,

              VEO,

              SAO, KO, Moscow Watchdog, Husky, Malamute, Laiki and some mestizos, as well as hunting dogs and

              breeds PP. It is very important to follow the timing rules and respect the proportion of protein, fat and carbohydrates

              in

              diet. With a mixed diet, meat is no longer required as much as say at BARF, and cereals are not needed at all

              -

              you should add more vegetables, herbs, give cottage cheese, quail eggs, kefir, berries according to the season - total

              what is missing in the stern.

              <br> <br>

              Vitamins with a mixed diet should not be given without a doctor's prescription! On a mixed diet, it is required

              delivery of biochemistry every 6 months and assessment of the output, as well as the external condition of the dog. Availability not

              overcooked

              pieces of food, putrid odor, bald patches and bald patches on the coat, flatulence and diarrhea - a serious reason

              refuse this power scheme. Most dog breeders in foreign kennels introduce into the diet

              young stock: tripe, book, kaltyki, udder, flank and heart, and for the EU - sea fish.

              <br> <br>

              Small puppies are given cottage cheese, kefir and quail eggs. Introduce these products smoothly and look at the exit and

              no allergies. Slight diarrhea (softening of the stool) and regurgitation of yellow foam at first -

              the permissible rate associated with the restructuring of the body. Mixed meals are also suitable for training,

              especially when the dog handler advises to move all the food outside. So you feed all the food on the street for

              work, and in the evening you give meat. Or vice versa - the dog works for meat, and in the evening eats food, as

              side dish. By the way, controversial vegetarian food was created just for this purpose. And finally, there is

              special feeds where you can add meat.

              <br> <br>

              The last thing I want to point out is that with a mixed diet, many veterinarians recommend soaking dry food in

              warm water for 10-15 minutes, this will reduce the difference between the two types of feedings. You can add to the feed itself

              a drop of olive oil or fish oil, for better palatability.

            <summary> Giardiasis in dogs </summary>

            <p> Giardiasis in dogs is considered one of the most common and complex diseases transmitted from

              animals

              a person and vice versa.

              <br> <br>

              The disease is difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to cure, because giardia can be present in

              the dog's body and not show itself in any way. The fight against them can drag on for a long time, because even after

              treatment

              soon they can again enter the pet's body.

              <br> <br>

              📚 Causative agents of disease 📚

              <br> <br>

              The causative agent of giardiasis is the unicellular organism Lamblia canis, which parasitizes in the upper regions

              small intestine in the form of trophozoites and immobile cysts, multiplying by paired division. Process

              reproduction takes about 20 minutes and the incubation period lasts 6 to 21 days. Therefore, parasites are very

              quickly affect the small intestine, freely moving along it, periodically attaching or penetrating

              inside the villi.

              <br> <br>

              Giardia die at temperatures above +50 degrees, but retain the ability to reproduce at

              short freezing. Cysts have increased viability, therefore, when trophozoites

              get into a dramatically changing environment, they turn back into cysts.

              <br> <br>

              ⁉️ How can a dog get infected ⁉️

              <br> <br>

              Giardia can be transmitted to animals from humans, but the likelihood of contracting them is much higher during

              walks.

              <br> <br>

              Cysts are present in puddles, melted snow, sea water, stagnant bodies of water, soil, on the surface

              fruit,

              faeces belonging to other infected dogs, as well as found in tap water and in

              dependencies

              from the ambient temperature retain their viability from several hours to 130 days.

              <br> <br>

              ⁉️ What is the danger of giardiasis in dogs ⁉️

              <br> <br>

              Parasites periodically stick, then detach from the villi, thereby damaging them. As a result

              the villi lose the ability to absorb the necessary substances, which means that the digestion process is disrupted, i.e.

              e.

              the absorption of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins decreases.

              <br> <br>

              The functions of the pancreas and liver are impaired and the risk of developing gallstone disease increases. By the way,

              lamblia cannot carry out their vital functions in the liver, as many think, but still can

              render

              negative impact on this internal organ.

              <br> <br>

              Against the background of giardiasis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, otitis media, weeping eczema can develop. Deteriorating quality

              wool,

              lethargy and fatigue are observed.

              <br> <br>

              With a prolonged course of the disease due to a lack of calcium in the dog's body, rickets may develop.

              <br> <br>

              📚 Symptoms 📚

              <br> <br>

              In difficult situations, the disease proceeds in an acute form, which lasts for one week and

              manifests itself as a slight increase in temperature, but most often the body temperature remains unchanged,

              nausea, flatulence and loose stools, decreased appetite, bloating.

              <br> <br>

              The manifestation of skin diseases, discoloration of the skin, itching, hair loss, as well as unpleasant

              smell from the mouth, plaque on the tongue.

              <br> <br>

              With a prolonged course of the disease, dogs have fatigue, bouts of aggression.

              <br> <br>

              💊 Treatment of giardiasis in dogs 💊

              <br> <br>

              Treatment should begin with a trip to the veterinarian, who, after conducting tests and examination, will be able to identify

              the nature of the disease and prescribe a course of treatment. Usually, giardiasis is detected by examining feces.

              If the dog is infected, cysts are present in the feces.

              <br> <br>

              It is impossible to completely cure a dog of giardiasis, since it is difficult to remove all cysts from the body.

              Giardia is able to adapt to chemicals.

              <br> <br>

              The most common treatments for giardiasis in dogs are antimicrobial drugs (Metronidazole) and

              anthelmintics such as fenbendazole, albendazole (better for puppies), and tiberal. Preparations can be

              prescribe to puppies, but not to pregnant and lactating bitches.

              <br> <br>

              📚 Prevention 📚

              <br> <br>

              The main rule - compliance with the rules of hygiene, applies not only to dogs, but also to the owner. The dog can't

              allow

              drink from puddles, pick up various objects from the street, eat feces, swim in unknown bodies of water. Should

              timely deworming.

              <br> <br>

              Water should be given only boiled, because when boiled, lamblia instantly die. </p>

            <summary> Diseases of dogs by age </summary>

 

            <p> What diseases do dogs have? Let's take a look at this. Diseases can pass from one

              age

              group to another and accompany the dog throughout life. For example, worms or fleas.

              We will start from the youngest age at which the puppy gets to new owners from the owner of the mother.

              let's get acquainted with the list of the most common serious illnesses.

              <br> <br>

              Age from three weeks to 2 months. <br> <br>

              We will say that you took the puppy healthy and cheerful. Brought home and here is the most common

              disease.

              Disruption of the gastrointestinal tract. Why? Overfed. New products were given.

              <br> <br>

              Age from 2 months to 4 months. <br> <br>

              1. If not vaccinated, then all known infectious diseases can occur.

              2. Rickets and osteomalacia, if the puppy lacks calcium and phosphorus in the diet.

              3. Allergic flea dermatitis. Just fleas and other arthropods.

              4. Food poisoning. We start walking on the street. Puppies pick up everything indiscriminately from the ground.

              5. Helminthic infestation if no anthelminthic drugs have been given prior to vaccination.

              6. Paraanal adeno-sinusitis. The name is tricky, but everything is just inflammation and overflow of paraanal

              sinuses.

              7. Allergic dermatitis.

              8. All malformations (cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, food allergy) are identified

              <br> <br>

              Age from 4 months to 9 months. <br> <br>

              Change of teeth. Teeth may not grow as they should. Milk teeth can linger with falling out, and

              formed

              malocclusion.

              Various injuries. At this age, males most often run away from their owners and can get hit by a car.

              Bitches usually begin their first heat and some pathologies associated with it.

              <br> <br>

              Age from 9 months to 5 years. <br> <br>

              If all preventive procedures were performed in advance, then this period is the most favorable for the dog.

              and

              owner.

              Usually at this age are found in males:

              Inflammation of the genitourinary system.

              Injuries as a result of fights with their own kind.

              Diseases of the skin.

              Bitches have their first and subsequent births. Sometimes complications of pregnancy and subsequent period.

              <br> <br>

              Age from 5 to 8 years old. <br> <br>

              Most responsible for dog owners. They did not miss anything, the dog continues to live on. Missed

              a symptom, even the most insignificant, of the disease develops like a snowball.

              In males:

              Osteosarcoma

              Testicular cancer

              Bitches have pyometra, mastitis, breast tumors.

              At this age, regardless of gender, in some cases, diseases of the heart, brain, lungs develop. And

              the toxins accumulated over life begin to affect the cells of the liver and pancreas.

              Diabetes mellitus and adrenal insufficiency are often diagnosed at this age.

              Scary to read. But this will not happen if at the age of 5 years the dog has undergone a complete examination with a fence.

              blood for general and biochemical analysis. She underwent an ultrasound scan and an electrocardiogram.

              <br> <br>

              Age from 8 to 10 years old. <br> <br>

              Usually, if the period from 5 to 8 years has passed calmly, then in the next 2 years you can relax.

              A quality-of-life treatment will help your dog live happily for two years.

              <br> <br>

              Age from 10 to 12 years old. <br> <br>

              All chronic diseases are aggravated. Due to the fact that in the wild, dogs do not live so long

              cardinal restructuring of the whole organism. Ischemic processes begin in almost all organs.

              The dog may lose hearing, vision. Cataracts and glaucoma develop. Only the most persistent can withstand

              dogs and owners. Most often at this age, dogs are killed, as the owners think that

              dog

              suffers, and they decide to end the torment.

              I can say that the dog does not experience moral and psychological torment. God spared the animals. We are tormented

              owners. It is intolerable to watch how our favorite is fading away, and we decide how fashionable it is now to speak in

              "Lulling to sleep". In my opinion, putting to sleep is anesthesia, after which the animal will wake up alive and well. And in our

              case it is murder, killing, euthanasia, as you please. Everything that I write in these lines is not

              condemnation. This is naming things by their proper names. I confess to you, I killed mine too

              fourteen year old

              mittelschnauzer after six months of cleaning up feces and urine in the apartment. And I believe that after these mine

              deeds

              troubles of all kinds fell on me. But these are my feelings.

              <br> <br>

              Ages 12 and up. <br> <br>

              Yes, I want to say that I have a patient at the age of 15. Also, some of my patients lived up to 13-14

              years, and these were Rottweilers, which is a great feat for them. The life of a dog after 12 years is completely in the hands

              owners.

              If they ask the dog to live as long as it can, then the dog usually lives as long as it is physically strong.

              To me

              had a chance to treat a lapdog, who at that time was 24 years old. The owners were worried about the incipient heart

              failure. And we decided to treat the dog.

              In this mailing list, I have tried to categorize the more common diseases by age. I certainly could have something

              skip. For some of the dog lovers, everything was different. This is how it should be. Everything in the world is different

            <summary> Amendments to the Veterinary Law </summary>

 

            <p> In Russia, they plan to change the rules for keeping and registering potentially dangerous animals at home, including

              the number of fighting dogs. The corresponding amendments to the law "On Veterinary Medicine" were submitted to the State Duma at the end of May

              Committee

              on ecology and environmental protection. If the bill is approved, Russia will be developed and approved

              list of "dogs of potentially dangerous breeds". Owners of such animals will be required to

              register your pets. True, there are no restrictions on keeping such dogs, in addition to their

              walking

              muzzled and on a leash, the draft law does not provide. <br> <br>

 

              For example, the rules for keeping fighting dogs in Germany are much stricter.

              To get a fighting dog, you have to follow a lot of strict instructions. And some breeds even

              prohibited by law.

              In addition to the national law, almost all federal states additionally have their own regulations

              keeping of such dogs, approved by the state parliaments. What kind of breeds are considered fighting? what

              should their owners know? Are the conditions of keeping such four-legged pets different in different

              federal

              lands? DW has tried to provide a detailed overview and answer the most important questions.

              <br> <br>

              What is a fighting dog?

              <br> <br>

              Dog fighting is still legal in many Asian countries

              There is no official concept of "fighting dog". Internationally recognized is the term "dog

              dangerous breed. "Nevertheless," fighting "is usually called the breed of dogs used in the late 18th century -

              early 19th century in dog fights.

              <br> <br>

              To make the fights more bloody and more spectacular, the owners of the animals participating in the fights began

              breed bulldogs with terriers. As a result, physically stronger, more aggressive and

              pain-insensitive breeds. Today, dogs of those breeds that are more often

              others

              attack or are supposed to be able to attack a person.

              <br> <br>

              What dogs are fighting dogs in Germany?

              <br> <br>

              The Federal Republic of Germany has a national law on the transportation and restrictions on the import of dogs. According to him,

              it is prohibited to import into Germany Pit Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Terriers, American Staffordshire

              terriers, bull terriers and mestizos of these breeds. Those who violate this law face punishment - from high

              monetary fines before imprisonment. Exceptions are allowed in cases where the owner of the animal can

              prove that ownership of this particular dog is dictated by an urgent need - for example, if dogs

              serve as guides or rescuers. In addition, a permit issued by

              by the police.

              <br> <br>

              As for other dogs recognized as dangerous, each federal state has its own law on

              them

              import and conditions of detention. The list of dangerous breeds also varies by federal state. IN

              in most cases, it also includes staffordshire terriers, staffordshire bull terriers, pit bulls,

              bull terriers and mestizos of these breeds. But there are lands in which many more breeds are considered fighting,

              for example, in Bavaria there are nineteen of them.

              <br> <br>

              Pit bulls in Germany are considered dangerous dogs

              In addition, in some lands the list is subdivided into two categories: the breeds listed in the first,

              are considered

              dangerous, in the second - potentially dangerous. Permission to keep dogs belonging to the first

              categories,

              issued only as exceptions - if there is a document of urgent need and a certificate of

              the owner's competence, which is issued by the police. The breeds included in the second category contain

              allowed, but only under certain conditions and restrictions.

              <br> <br>

              For example, in Brandenburg and Hamburg, the second category includes Rottweilers, Neapolitano mastino and

              mastiffs,

              in Bavaria - Cane Corso, Argentine and Bordeaux mastiffs, American Bulldogs. In Berlin, Bremen,

              Hesse,

              Saxony and some other states are not categorized. In Thuringia, Lower Saxony and

              Schleswig-Holstein there are no lists of fighting dogs. In these federal states, the reason for recognizing

              a dog is dangerous, it is not its belonging to a certain breed, but the manifestation of a specific animal

              signs of increased aggression.

              <br> <br>

              What documents are required to keep a fighting dog?

              <br> <br>

              The owner of a dog listed as a dangerous breed must have a document confirming it

              competence

              in the treatment of your pet, the so-called "dog walking rights" (Sachkundenachweis or

              Hundeführerschein). In addition, it is necessary to conclude a special insurance against liability for causing

              harm to others (Haftpflichtversicherung) and register the animal at the land registration center

              dogs.

              <br> <br>

              Dogs of dangerous breeds can only be walked in a muzzle and on a leash

              For the possession of fighting dogs, an increased tax is charged, the amount of which varies not only within

              country, but also one federal state. For example, in Dusseldorf, which is located in the federal state

              North Rhine-Westphalia, the tax on a regular dog is € 96 per year, and on a fighting dog € 600 per

              year.

              In Dortmund, located in the same federal state, the annual tax on a regular dog is 156

              Euro,

              for fighting - 468 euros.

              <br> <br>

              Dogs of dangerous breeds must be walked only on a leash and in a muzzle, the animal must be

              castrated or sterilized, you cannot visit public events and places of mass gatherings

              of people. In addition, the owner of the dog must be of legal age. Penalties for non-compliance with containment rules

              very harsh - up to 10 thousand euros.

              <br> <br>

              Dog walking rights - what is it?

              <br> <br>

              A certificate of competence or the right to walk a dog is a document confirming that

              owner

              skills and abilities necessary for keeping a dog. In order to get such a "crust", you need to pass

              exam consisting of two parts: theoretical and practical.

              <br> <br>

              In the first, a series of multiple-choice questions must be answered; in the second, the host must

              show that he is able to cope with his dog in all situations, and she has no idea

              danger

              for others. The exam is taken by specially trained instructors in the police or kennel clubs, it

              lasts about an hour and costs between 60 and 130 euros.

              <br> <br>

              What is a dog behavior exam?

              <br> <br>

              To obtain permission to keep a dog of a dangerous breed, its owner, in addition to a certificate of

              competence, you must pass the dog behavior test (Wesenstest) with your pet. The exam consists of

              of three parts, in each of which specially trained dog handlers observe the behavior of the animal in

              various stressful situations. Dog obedience is critical.

              <br> <br>

              The animal's reaction to a gaze in the eyes, a shout of a stranger, to a meeting with

              a person who is intoxicated, with a runner, cyclist, moving child

              stroller or other dog. To pass this exam, the dog must show no signs.

              aggression. In this case, the owner of the animal is issued a certificate confirming that his pet is not

              poses a danger to others.

              <br> <br>

              If not, the instructor or veterinarian must decide if the dog is amenable to additional

              training, whether it needs to undergo special "therapy" or it needs to be confiscated. Test you need

              pass

              every two years, its price varies depending on the region </p>

              (folk canine wisdom)

              <br> <br>

              I very often listen to complaints from owners that the dog spoils furniture, carpets, clothes, pissing anywhere and

              other ..

              <br> <br>

              Coming home, you do not recognize the apartment, and your dog is sleeping peacefully on the remains of your furniture or clothes .. I think

              everyone is familiar with this situation. An unsuspecting puppy runs to greet you, but you already

              overwhelmed with anger and lash out at him .. The puppy looks guilty, and you think that he knows and

              understands what you are punishing him for. Nothing like this! He assumes a guilty look and a pose of submission to

              you stopped scolding him as soon as possible. He can NOT understand what you are punishing him for, if the case is already

              done, and after the "crime" he managed to sleep peacefully. He will simply consider you inadequate and

              unbalanced personality, trust will be undermined.

              <br> <br>

              Many owners say - "The cage is inhuman!" Then answer the question: "And to punish a puppy,

              when he doesn't even understand why - is it human !? "

              <br> <br>

              What is a dog cage?

              Every dog ​​has a "lair instinct". You've probably noticed that dogs usually love

              settle down

              in protected places - under a bed, under a table, in corners, ... - in places where there is a roof and walls.

              The dog's cage will become its den, its own apartment, if properly trained to it.

              If you have children - the cage is a salvation for the dog, where no one will disturb its rest.

              If you need to transport a dog, the cage will help you with this again.

              <br> <br>

              What should be the cage?

              It is desirable from iron rods - it is reliable, ventilated and the dog will have an overview, it can

              watch

              behind everything that happens.

              Size - the dog should stand upright in the cage, turn around and lie down stretched out.

              It is better to put the cage in the corner - not on the aisle, so that there is comfort and security, not in a draft and not near

              from

              battery.

              The cage should contain the dog's bedding, her favorite toys, a drinker and snacks (special bones,

              eg).

              Basic tips for cage training

              First, keep the cage door open at all times. Do not close the dog in it until it

              get used to

              to the cage.

              The cage should contain the dog's bedding and favorite toys.

              First you need to feed the dog in the cage. Treats such as special bones are also given in the cage.

              The dog should receive all the tastiest and most enjoyable in the cage.

              As soon as the dog begins to fall asleep in the cage, consider that the main stage has been passed.

              After that, you can begin to close the door to the cage during her sleep, but at the same time you must be in

              room - do not leave the dog alone. As soon as she starts to wake up, open the door.

              When she gets used to being quietly in a cage with a closed door in your presence, you can start

              leave her there alone, but don't leave the apartment yet. Left the room - came back - praised the dog,

              if

              she sat quietly.

              It is very important: if the dog starts barking in the cage - DO NOT let it go and do not come into the room to bark!

              Otherwise, she will think: "barked - they paid attention to me, they let me out of the cage!" Wait for a break in

              bark - then go and let her out.

              When you learn to be in a cage for a long time when you are at home, start leaving the apartment.

              At first, briefly, gradually increasing the time of absence.

              Very important: if you hear a dog barking - DO NOT enter the apartment - wait until it calms down -

              only then go in and praise her. She must understand that only her quiet and calm stay in

              cage

              will speed up your arrival.

              <br> <br>

              What NOT to do:

              - do not send the dog to the crate as a punishment

              - do not overuse keeping the dog in the cage

              - do not leave the dog in a crate with a leash and collar

              - never force a dog into a crate

              <br> <br>

              You don't have to be afraid of the cage and think that this is a mockery of the dog. If everything is done correctly - a dog

              will love the cage and consider it his home, because every living creature sometimes needs to be alone,

              take a break from everyone (especially if you have children). </p>

              <br> <br>

              And at first, as long as all the droppings are under one cover, there really is no difference; but it is in

              how do you examine the puppies.

              <br> <br>

              And here you see: This dog is different from the usual, "average"! what is this puppy in the litter? FROM

              from the very beginning he is very lively, even aggressive, repelling others from food; he is spinning on you

              hands;

              he never shrinks, shrinks with fear when a shadow falls into the corral, or his nostrils

              an unfamiliar smell reaches. This is a brave, sturdy, strong puppy with good growth potential. (On this

              stage

              there is no refinement!). He has a good puppy coat, perhaps not even silky and not fine, but

              thick, soft and copious. It is better if there is no hint of wavy hair in the future. If the puppy is not

              possesses

              in the sum of all these qualities - health, courage, good growth potential and a good coat - this

              not the puppy that you need, bearing in mind our hopes for his brilliant show career.

              <br> <br>

              To be victorious at all levels, your puppy must have these virtues from the very first days.

              life! You will not have time to develop these qualities in him; You have so much work to do, you have to

              much to do to develop these qualities in even the best puppy to the extent necessary to

              champion of your dreams, that you only have enough time for its worthy cultivation.

              <br> <br>

              At two months old, still in company with his littermates, is he different from them?

              Undoubtedly !!!

              <br> <br>

              He must be different if he is to fulfill your dreams. It became clear that he had

              excellent large feet, with thick pads and long, tied toes, when standing and walking

              collected in a ball, arched. In addition, because he is well-behaved and very well built, he

              the strong small body looks short and stocky, and it jumps and trot very decisively. (You

              not

              should be embarrassed by some puppy vigor, and the wide "open" chest when viewed from the front

              is considered a great asset.) He is actually quite stocky, but not so short that

              not

              have a long, high-set neck and a good sloping shoulder.

              <br> <br>

              His head still looks a little too big for the torso. This is good - it means there is still a possibility

              for

              growth. However, the head should not be soggy and / or rough; it is possible that his muzzle looks a little

              short, but it has a strong lower jaw and a voluminous forceps. His head shouldn't be over the top

              long, light and weak muzzle if you want a perfect head in the future. The transition from forehead to muzzle in

              this age is almost the same as in an adult dog. It has gorgeous, rather wide and

              long ears, set closer to the back of the head on soft cartilage, lively dark eyes, small, triangular

              forms.

              They already shine with mischievous fun, good nature and depth. Breed pride and "mysterious oriental

              expression "will appear in them much later ... The puppy feels you. As soon as you come, he often drops everything

              and

              tries to win your attention and love. From now on, although your puppy will also play with

              his family, every day he must spend part of the time with people, and the more, the better.

              <br> <br>

              If he lives in a house, he walks through different rooms and meets different people, some of whom are strangers,

              strangers. He picks up new smells and, most importantly, he hears unfamiliar strange sounds. Not happening

              nothing

              sudden, and everything that happens gives the puppy pleasure. People talk to him, caress him,

              encouraging.

              If he lives in a nursery, he visits the house, kitchen, living room. He learns to walk up stairs, ride on

              car,

              gets used to a lot of strangers.

              <br> <br>

              He is almost not scolded, not spanked, he does not hear harsh frightening sounds, although there is a lot of noise around him,

              voices, radio and TV sounds, the clatter of pots and pans, the sound of a hairdryer, a shovel, scraping

              asphalt, etc.

              <br> <br>

              Every day, several times for a very short time, he is put in a rack on a table, on an exhibition cage,

              on

              floor. When the baby stands calmly and motionless, for at least two or three seconds, he is praised and given as a reward

              something tasty. He begins to like this posing, and we just need this, as it is necessary for him to

              I liked everything related to exhibitions.

              He is washed and combed, like all his brothers and sisters, but he is given more time and attention,

              simply

              in order for him to love it. Its coat should never be dirty or matted. He is well

              they feed him, they play and talk a lot with him. They walk with him, give him lessons that he likes, and also give

              the opportunity to get plenty of sleep. All this requires a lot of time and attention from you, about which he has no

              the slightest

              concepts. You will have to devote even more time and even more attention to your puppy as he

              grows up.

              <br> <br>

              Now is the time for some short leash walking lessons to be done with such love,

              patience and imagination so the puppy will love them. He does not actually feel that he is being “taught to

              a leash "

              for this is done quite unobtrusively. A light leash, which he barely feels, hangs freely while he

              eating; then "he follows" him around the room and is not averse to playing with him, but the owner has tidbits and

              so

              the puppy follows the leash, which leads him to the place where the puppy can have a light snack. Then the puppy

              "Leads" its owner on a leash. So funny! Then they all go to the yard together for a walk, which

              seems awfully short, because it is so sweet! Walking on a leash, the puppy keeps its tail up all the time,

              because he likes to go with his master, and also because the owner seems to have something in store

              for

              puppy. The kid looks up all the time in anticipation. Once or twice he will find that the leash

              keeps

              him, and he jumps and begins to "fight" with him, but the owner sits down next to him and "discusses" with the puppy

              situation. They then move on in the other direction, and the puppy forgets that he is being held. Now he

              knows

              that "he is being led," but he no longer minds, for he likes to walk on a leash. (Of course, it's broken

              resistance to the leash, but not his spirit; no one encroached on it.) For a puppy, the world should always remain

              themes

              a place where he lives joyfully, interestingly, actively, in contact with people around him whom he loves and

              whom he seeks to please in his own way, because he feels their love for himself.

              <br> <br>

              Now it's time to evaluate the puppy in another aspect. It is necessary to contact a specialist so that he

              watched the puppy walk on a leash. What are his movements? We see him running gracefully and cheerfully, but

              is he moving correctly? If the answer is no, - this puppy should be a pet in the house and, undoubtedly -

              The "champion" but not the champion of your dreams. With a positive answer in the life of the puppy, some

              change.

              <br> <br>

              Changes come to a puppy's life not very abruptly and suddenly, because you cannot put a good test

              character and cheerful disposition. Leash walking lessons continue, but now, the leash is often held in hand

              strangers - a neighbor, or someone from the family, or someone from the nursery staff. Exhibition lessons

              the stands and demonstrations of oneself become considerably longer. Someone else's hands touch him, feel,

              caress. And it pleases him. Very soon the puppies get used to the fact that strangers put him in the right position,

              and

              he demonstrates himself.

              <br> <br>

              And every day the puppy walks a lot, spends time in active play with peers, (only with one or two, and

              the most calm ones who do not pull the coat). It should never get tangled and / or break off with

              ends, but at the same time only dead hair should be removed from the coat. In winter, the puppy receives vitamins,

              and

              on cloudy, rainy days, he is taught to pose in a room with a sun lamp.

              <br> <br>

              Sometimes he is taken by car to the city. He walks on a leash through the streets, enters (if permitted) in

              the shops. He sees many strangers, hears many different new sounds. The owner never rushes him,

              and

              since the owner takes everything around for granted and behaves calmly and confidently, the puppy has all this

              also does not cause any concern. In addition, at first such "sorties" were not long and

              took place at a time when the puppy felt great and was in the most vigorous mood. TO

              besides, for the first time to such an event, you can take out the mother of the puppy so that he can see that she is absolutely not

              excited about what is happening.

              <br> <br>

              And then the day comes when the puppy is led on a leash in a circle., Then back and forth, and after that they put

              for

              posing, but this time everything happens in the company of 2-3 unfamiliar dogs (of any breed), which also

              some people are being led in a circle on a leash. Completely unafraid, your puppy breaks and pulls on the leash,

              so that

              to reach them, but you hold him gently (but very decisively) with your voice and leash. Finally, his

              "Dawns" that they should all walk on a leash in a circle one after the other, not trying to catch up with each other, that

              they should also stand quietly in a stance side by side without trying to sniff and / or grab each other. When

              kid

              gradually understands everything and goes right, on a loose leash, he receives a reward from generous praise and

              affection, and if he poses calmly, he is not only praised, but also given tidbits.

              <br> <br>

              This strange procedure is repeated for several days, and then one day they sit down and become

              people. They talk and sometimes even shout and clap. The puppy is puzzled, but he doesn't mind.

              The rest of the dogs also do not pay any attention to what is happening, and soon he does the same.

              way. He doesn't know that this is a home improvised show ring, but he feels like

              at home, because he goes there every day.

              <br> <br>

              Soon he passes another test, a rather unpleasant quality, but to the part - next to him are

              people he loves and trusts, and these people talk to the puppy. The puppy is put in the wire

              cage

              and close the door. Of course, since this is a wire cage, he can see everything around through the bars, but she

              rather cramped and there are no other puppies in it. Therefore, he gets a little worried, squeaks, and pounds on the door with his paw.

              However, he is allowed to chew on a large juicy bone, and people - his friends, talk to him. Therefore, after two or three

              day, he perceives all this as something normal, ordinary. After another week, the wire cage is replaced

              a box-booth, where only one wall is made of rods, and only through it he sees, moreover, not very

              well. It is much darker in it, and, being healthy and fearless, the puppy howls loudly and with all his might

              scratched

              in the door. However, he gets another equally delicious bone (and besides, he is already tired of that

              the moment when he was placed in the box, because he was given plenty of running and frolic). People he knows

              are nearby and calm him down. After crying a little, he sighs, puts his face on the bone and falls asleep. Now

              every day after classes and walks, he goes to this booth to sleep. She already smells him, she is comfortable

              there

              he hides his bone - and the puppy begins to love it.

              <br> <br>

              Sometimes he spends the whole night there, but in most cases he still sleeps in the same place where he lived with

              brothers and sisters, and now he was alone. He also runs for a walk alone, although other puppies, his friends,

              very often near.

              <br> <br>

              The puppy is six months old. He is fearless, he is used to being alone, he walks well on a leash, he likes

              pose and he has a great coat. What does he look like?

              <br> <br>

              His head is now in proportion to his strong, sturdy body; and this is a beautiful chiseled head, strong, but

              graceful, elegant, but clearly the head of a dog. He has a proud posture, his muscles are strengthened, and in each of his

              movement feels strength and lightness. He is temperamental and proud. In fact, trimmed or not

              trimmed, starting in puppy class six to nine months old, he could easily become a winner and

              even

              The best of the winners, but that's not your goal. This young dog must defeat the best of the best and become

              The best of the breed.

              <br> <br>

              Therefore, one afternoon or evening, he will find himself in a new, extremely crowded place, where a crowd of

              a lot of strangers with dogs. He is not that scared, but rather simply surprised and curious about everything.

              His beloved master-handler, of course, next to him, encourages him in his own words, and here are several

              familiar dogs. He enters the ring - this is a familiar thing, he stands in a regal pose, while some

              man

              examines him. Then he moves again, happy and confident, dressed in thick shiny fur.

              Then he stops, stands magnificently, showing off his exterior, and his handler gets the tape. is he

              won his first unofficial exhibition, but the only thing that is absolutely clear to him is that

              his master is pleased. The puppy is pleased. They attend several of these shows, where the puppy performs successfully,

              but at home more and more time is now devoted to trotting. The puppy does not know this, but the owner is trying

              to reveal

              the best tempo (rhythm) of movements for your pet. From the moment he succeeds, the puppy will be driven

              in such a favorable rhythm for him until the young dog does it

              automatically on a free leash.

              <br> <br>

              The puppy also gains a different experience. He meets with a dog, also walking on a leash, but older than him and completely

              not friendly. The dog growls and lunges at the puppy. The frightened puppy cringes or falls fearfully into

              ground, crawled to the offender, wagging his tail, trying to appease him. Then the owner leans over to the puppy, caresses,

              encourages and confidently puts you on your feet. If the puppy reacts actively, barks, or tries to play with

              “The aggressor2, the owner praises him and lets him pull on the leash. He wants the puppy to be bold. Now the puppy

              there are a number of unfriendly dogs, but he soon realizes that growls and throws do not matter,

              since the dogs cannot reach him because of the leash, and he also cannot reach them. He is the same

              understands that he is also a significant person and should not be servile, because he has his own rights. is he

              confined to an ominous growl or a sharp throw in the direction of the offender, a firm gaze and very arrogant

              threatening pose.

              <br> <br>

              The puppy learns to be calm about camera flashes. When he stands next to the owner, someone

              will definitely photograph him with a flash. Nothing bad happens - just a flash and then

              a piece of film.

              <br> <br>

              By this time, the puppy already has a lot of thick, not too long hair - he was well fed, he has enough

              rested and walked, (not just ran or wandered anywhere, but followed along a flat road or on a solid

              naked

              field behind the bike handler). The puppy only knows that he feels great. But him

              the owner knows that real walks not only develop muscles, but also promote proper exchange

              substances, and this is the secret of the beauty of the dog and the healthy shine of the coat. Many show dogs are not

              enough active walks, so they become "frail" and they have problems with their coat and even

              skin diseases. This young dog is always hungry and he always gets the best: good beef,

              liver, high-quality cereals, natural butter, sometimes stewed onions and tomatoes, occasionally eggs,

              cottage cheese and milk. He feels good all the time, and since he is healthy and happy, he wants more than just

              to play, but also to please your friend - the owner. They talked to him a lot, so he

              learned

              listen. Now he knows when he did something right and when he didn't. He doesn't want to "fail"

              and,

              accustomed to communicating with a person, he is waiting for his approval, praise.

              <br> <br>

              Now, if the puppy has to leave the house to go "to school" to a professional handler, his

              the current owner-handler begins to attract other people to walks and activities with the puppy and to his

              feeding. The young dog barely notices. That he sees a loved one less and less, and even when he

              sees

              him, their relationship becomes, as it were, less intimate. However, the puppy does not grieve as it does.

              gradually, the people with whom he is now dealing seem very nice to him, they are also a lot

              talk to him and caress him.

              <br> <br>

              He always loved people and they continue to delight him. And when he finally leaves the house, the new handler in

              equally admires him and finds the puppy simply incredibly perfect. Handler is left with only

              keep the puppy in the same condition in which he got to him: gorgeous, strong front

              limbs,

              powerful ass, lovely paws, adorable head, wonderful short coat of a young dog,

              temperament at work and good manners in the house. “He is already the Best Dog in the Show. See how

              he

              obedient, how calm. And how he moves - from a place he takes the right pace, as soon as we start moving! " -

              so the handler says. But the owner replies: “Wait. Let him work with you a little more; remember, that

              he should defeat much older, more experienced dogs. "

              <br> <br>

              If the puppy is left at home and the owner is going to exhibit him (who is a professional, and no

              needs

              address to someone), then their relationship becomes even closer and a reliable invisible thread

              as if holds two beings together. A tandem, a "team" appears. They do a lot together, they go everywhere

              together,

              meet new people, and the puppy, who has already become a young dog, is very fond of showing himself,

              when he poses on a loose leash (hands-free display stand), while people wait for him

              will consider

              and feel. Each sound of the "wonderful" voice of the owner is full of special meaning for him, he has forgotten his

              friends-dogs and merged together with the beloved human being, and since he is a dog, this is all that he

              need to. He understands that his very movement on a leash and posing bring joy to his dear friend,

              and

              that this joy is connected with the way they run: one, two, three, four, leg to leg, and then full

              immobility in an exhibition pose! .. A young dog does not seem very entertaining, but if this

              if you want your beloved owner, please - he is ready for it.

              <br> <br>

              Then one day he finds himself in one of those places that are overflowing with dogs and people. He has nothing

              against, since he was used to it for a long time. The only difference is that today his friend - the owner seems

              a little worried and nervous The dog feels this, because he loves him immensely. He looks around, but not

              discovers nothing unusual, so he decides to try and "please" the person as best he can. Can

              it will help ... How beautifully he flies along the diagonal of the ring, looking a couple of times at this beloved face.

              "Well done!" - says the owner, and the dog calms down when he catches a pleased tone of voice. While they

              act,

              there is a restrained hum of voices around the ring, the puppy does not really notice it, but still it is an encouraging sound.

              Yes, now everything is fine. He wags his tail in delight and takes a stance with a special regal

              dignity

              and immobility. Then his owner lets go of the leash and steps aside, and a stranger approaches him

              a man, probes him, looks at his teeth and raises his paws. And the young dog stands motionless all the time, she

              only faintly wags its tail.

              <br> <br>

              And again, the adult puppy and its owner run first in a circle, and then leave the ring, and then again along

              ring with other dogs. And every time the young dog does everything with military precision and with great desire. is he

              tries with might and main and gets pleasure from it. And here's the last time in the ring. And then a huge mastiff

              rushes not to him! .. The puppy raises his head even higher, his eyes light up with a dark cold light

              arrogance and contempt, his tail freezes - but he does not break the rhythm of the flight-flight: one, two, three, four -

              easily and clearly, as the owner wants it. "Well done ..." - a human voice whispers and the dog is doubly happy, for

              he

              “Sacrificed” the person without answering the challenge. Now posing again, again - off the leash. Around the ring

              thunderous applause is heard, but the young dog does not move, head and tail are raised,

              the owner and into the distance - a magnificent sculpture. Then the owner takes the leash and they run as they always do -

              one, two, three, four - to the place indicated by number 1, where the person is handed ribbons. A sense of joy this time

              unites the dog and the person. Almost an adult puppy does not quite understand why his owner looks terrible

              satisfied. He feels the man's hand patting his head especially tenderly. And getting a kiss on the nose

              he

              cannot stand still with joy and relief.

              <br> <br>

              And the same joy and relief is experienced by his master, for he now knows that he has raised a champion!

              Handler: Sleight of hand and no cheating.

            </summary>

            <p> Elena Timkina is a well-known Russian breeder of American Staffordshires and Bull Terriers, owner of the cattery

              "Chebens Tebel". She considers participation in exhibitions to be the main direction in the work of her nursery and is

              to

              this is extremely serious.

              <br> <br>

              Lena, the first question, which may have already become traditional: what advice do you have for beginners who want

              participate

              with your dog at shows?

              <br> <br>

              - First: take a dog in a famous kennel. Good breeders have a stake in their own best

              the puppies have been shown, they will do their best to help the owner really want to have

              show dog, choose a puppy and prepare it correctly.

              <br> <br>

              And second: choose a good handler for yourself. I am for professional handlers. This is a job, this is a profession, so

              accepted all over the world. This is a craft that requires talent, knowledge, experience. Naturally, owners meet,

              who want to show their dogs on their own. They can turn to an experienced handler who will become

              for

              trainer, help prepare the dog and teach the owner how to exhibit.

              <br> <br>

              What guides you when choosing a puppy for a show?

              <br> <br>

              - Puppies are different: one is born with a natural desire to be in sight, with a desire to please, and the other, more

              balanced, “prefers” to stay at home and “be loved”.

              <br> <br>

              An exhibition is a show, not a tribal show, and a show needs bright colors. Therefore, when choosing a puppy with

              with the prospect of participating in exhibitions, we certainly appreciate his "courage", that is, temperament,

              "ostentatious", the presence of sparkle in the eyes, the desire to work. The show dog should be like a model,

              who is ready to go to the podium and say "I am the most beautiful here, the most wonderful."

              <br> <br>

              From my point of view, an important detail is color. A promising puppy should be brightly colored. To me

              I like it when there is a lot of white, the spots are bright, well-located. A "bad" spot can hide

              "grease"

              any dignity. Bright asymmetrical markings are also undesirable. Many experts assess only

              "eyes" (especially, this is typical of "non-breed"), moreover, most of the premises have insufficient

              lighting. It is very important, especially in numerous rings, to attract the attention of an expert, but unsuccessfully

              a spotted or "pale" color can spoil the impression.

              <br> <br>

              You claim that for a show dog, courage is a quality that should be put first, and

              exterior dignity - on the second?

              <br> <br>

              - Of course, we must not forget about "anatomy", you cannot make a show dog out of a poorly built individual. But the point is

              that there are dogs that are anatomically correct, but they lack temperament, and therefore they

              lose.

              Maybe they don't like moving, they don't like being in the ring, they don't like to show, and that's why they

              can play out to a dog, simpler in anatomy, but more "showy", with a desire to work.

              <br> <br>

              Could you describe in general terms your principles of training show dogs. When to start

              training?

              <br> <br>

              - As I said, we help the owners to choose a promising puppy and, naturally, we always give

              recommendations on how to deal with your pet. Working with a puppy begins from the first days

              appearances in the house. (Moreover, experienced breeders start even earlier: some, for example, put puppies in

              rack already at 2 weeks of age.)

              <br> <br>

              The puppy needs to be given a few days to get comfortable in the new house, to determine what stimuli the puppy is

              responds better (treat, toys, praise) and start practicing with it. The main "incentives" used

              when preparing dogs, these are food instincts and "toys". There are much more food workers among amstaffs, and

              behold

              bull terriers, as a rule, work with great interest "for toys".

              <br> <br>

              First of all, we must teach the puppy "to the hand" ... After all, the handler (from the English word Hand "- hand) -

              this

              a person who works with his hands, you can say so: "handler: sleight of hand and no fraud."

              It is necessary that the puppy from childhood falls in love with the hands of the person who deals with him, understands that the "hand" feeds,

              caresses, strokes, scratches behind the ear, then touches everywhere: on the paws, tummy, teeth ...

              <br> <br>

              It usually starts with a treat in hand. We train the puppy to constantly monitor the hand, always

              there should be all the fun. A little later, a "pocket" is added to the hand, in which there is always a treat.

              A new game begins: "hand - pocket". (In the ring, after all, you cannot hold all the toys and delicacies in your hand, in

              suit

              handler must have a "pocket".) Then, for example, you can tie a piece of sausage

              on

              thread and hang it in the place where the puppy eats, so that he looks, sniffs.

              <br> <br>

              It is easy for a 1.5-month-old puppy to get involved in this game: look for a treat or a toy, then you need to teach him

              freeze in front of the found object (first, only for a few seconds, then longer). In the next step

              we

              we begin to coordinate the stance: fix the neck with our hands, adjust the legs, support the tail to

              the puppy is accustomed to the breed-specific stance, so that the puppy, trying to find a treat or favorite toy,

              I was constantly in suspense, in "swagger".

              <br> <br>

              After 2 months we teach the puppy a leash - "ringovka". In the beginning, again, it should be a game: in

              eyelet

              the dainty was shown so that the puppy reached for it and put on the leash himself. Praised, removed. Interesting

              a game! Then again the "ringing" was tired of being fixed on the neck, praised, given a treat, removed, and so on.

              <br> <br>

              The next stage begins when we start walking with the puppy. The walk is also a constant game, during

              which, while playing, we teach [or, teaching, we play]. First we fix and encourage the stance, then we begin to teach

              puppy move next to us by hand. A walk is movement. [In the exhibition, the ability to move means

              the ability to win!] Keep the puppy close to you ~ time is needed not by commands and a leash, interest, that

              there

              in our hand? Then "legs" appear, which are next to the puppy running after the hand.

              <br> <br>

              In the classroom, we make sure that the puppy is attentive and focused. And when it melts, we give it

              the opportunity to relax and be distracted so that he can play for a while on his own, then we remind you that

              beloved hand with something tasty, with his attention and start again.

              <br> <br>

              From 6 months of age physical training of the puppy, special training begins. [The model cannot

              go to the podium in bad physical shape!). Training is also necessary because the premises are not

              they are always quite comfortable, and in the ring, sometimes they "drive" for a long time. The breather will let you down and you cannot

              win.

              <br> <br>

              Therefore, on truancy we run, jump, dig holes, etc. But exhibitions must have a system,

              like in sports. Incorrect loads (overloads) can cause problems with the musculoskeletal system.

              Better

              turn to a professional, and he, taking into account the individual characteristics of the dog, will offer a complex

              exercise,

              which will allow you to be more productive.

              <br> <br>

              You insist that ring training should be based solely on play, taste -

              incentive methods?

              <br> <br>

              - Yes. Handling is a serious game. Training begins in play, and the older the puppy, the more "serious" the play.

              (As in sports: more patience, more endurance, more demands for the need for "stable"

              results

              work). Sometimes ring dogs are trained on "hard" methods. But this, in my opinion, is much less

              effectively. You can achieve obedience by forcing, "breaking" the dog.

              <br> <br>

              Perhaps she will stand well in the rack and move correctly. But at the same time, the dog at any time

              can

              "wake up individuality" (as a rule, at the most crucial moment!), she will say "I do not want, do not

              I'll go "... No, handling, this is a" gingerbread ", this is a" game ", the dog should have only positive emotions.

              <br> <br>

              How do dogs differ in intelligence, how quickly do they learn lessons?

              <br> <br>

              - Dogs are smart, They quickly understand how different PEOPLE CAN be "treated", WHO should be obeyed, and whom

              no. As for ring training: one puppy needs 15 minutes to understand everything, while the other learns

              the whole

              a life.

              <br> <br>

              What to do if the dog is not interested in playing and does not want to play this Game with us?

              <br> <br>

              - There is only one advice: contact a professional and try to figure out with him why the dog does not want

              work. Most likely, you yourself are doing something wrong. But any stubborn puppy always has

              more

              "stubborn" handler who will try to outwit him, find a special approach.

              <br> <br>

              The handler, being a connoisseur of his breed, will help you adjust the stance and find the most

              winning;

              choose the pace of movement (which depends on the breed, age of the dog, its physical fitness, on the size

              ring, quality of coverage, "requests" of the judge, time allotted for examination of the dog, quantity and quality

              competitors).

              <br> <br>

              One handler can cook and exhibit another (or the owner himself). But working with the dog in the ring

              necessary

              follow certain principles, you need to know what the dog training was built on. It is possible that

              the owner will cook the dog (under the guidance of the handler), and the handler will go to the ring.

              <br> <br>

              This is advisable because there is always a special emotional bond between the owner and the dog, and

              if the owner is worried going into the ring, together with him and the dog begins to feel uncomfortable, do not

              understanding what is happening with the owner. Even experienced handlers get excited in the ring with their own

              dog.

              But with someone else's handler is less emotional and can build work more productively.

              <br> <br>

              At what age should you bring your puppy to the show for the first time?

              <br> <br>

              - It is advisable to start exhibiting the dog from 4 months old, in the baby class. Toddlers are easier to adapt to

              in an unusual environment, they get used to it faster, experience less stress than, for example, 10-month-old puppies.

              Moreover, the goal of the first puppy shows is not a victory at all. The puppy needs to be given to understand what an exhibition is and

              boxing ring,

              to accustom him to the unusual setting of the exhibition, its "regime". If you didn't manage to go to the exhibition for the first time

              in

              4 Months, at the age of six months, try Be sure to do this.

              <br> <br>

              What can you advise when the puppy first visits the show?

              <br> <br>

              The first visit to the show should bring only positive emotions to the puppy: from dogs, from strangers

              of people,

              from the ring, from the expert. Remember to protect, love, and cherish your puppy. Be careful not to

              were frightened by adult animals (now, as a rule, quite well-bred dogs come to the exhibition, but

              and

              they may not be in the mood). Carry it on your hands, if he gets tired, give him a rest in the cage.

              <br> <br>

              What is "correct" movement and "courage"?

              <br> <br>

              The terrier should move at a trot, head up, and proud posture. The movements are sweeping, stable.

              A joyfully wagging tail that emphasizes good mood. The dog smiles. All of the above

              develops into a single image of a courageous dog who enjoys work. And with her

              enjoys and handler.

              <br> <br>

              We win, we are happy, and the dogs are happy with us: their efforts were not in vain. Experienced

              exhibition

              the dog realizes that it is entering the ring to "win", it realizes that it is irresistible. It even happens that when

              the handler gets nervous at a particularly crucial moment, the dog, an experienced show fighter, supports

              his

              morally, showing beautifully and, as it were, saying "we are the best here ..."

              <br> <br>

              What nuances does the handler consider when preparing for the exhibition?

              <br> <br>

              - The handler individually selects clothes, in accordance with the color of the dog, takes into account what kind of shoes you can

              dress (depending on the coverage of the ring). Sometimes you have to select a handler for height (for example, very

              a large dog is best displayed for a tall person). Handler is generally a good psychologist. He must

              manage your (and not only your!) emotions.

              <br> <br>

              Sometimes from not very experienced or not very lucky exhibitors accusations are heard that they won not

              a dog, but a well-known handler, whom all judges recognize by sight ... In this regard, the question: "adjusts"

              whether

              in any way a handler for an expert?

              <br> <br>

              - An experienced handler is always ready to offer the owner a reasonable individual exhibition schedule for his

              dogs,

              taking into account her age, level of her preparedness and competitiveness. When we make a schedule

              of the exhibitions in which we are going to take part, the persons of experts play, of course, an important role.

              we

              we already know: this expert likes one thing, the other likes another, who prefers which type.

              Learned Helplessness

            </summary>

 

            <p>

              Learned helplessness was discovered by the American psychologist Martin Seligman. The dogs locked themselves in

              the aviary and received an electric shock at the sound signal. Signaling had nothing to do with behavior

              dogs,

              dogs could not predict when an electric shock would occur and could not prevent it.

              <br> <br>

              Then these same dogs were moved to the aviary, from which it was possible to escape. Seligman expected that upon hearing

              shock signal the dogs will run away to avoid pain. However, the result was stunning:

              the dogs did not even try to jump over the low walls of the enclosure, they resignedly remained in place,

              lay down, whined and received electric shocks.

              <br> <br>

              In 1976, Martin Seligman received the American Psychological Association's Discovery of Learned

              helplessness.

              <br> <br>

              The same thing happens in life: when a dog loses the ability to control or influence

              unpleasant

              the event develops a strong sense of helplessness. If the dog is for a long time:

              - is defeated despite all efforts

              - going through difficult situations in which her actions do not affect anything

              - finds himself in the midst of chaos, where the rules are constantly changing and any movement can lead to punishment

              <br> <br>

              her will and desire to do something in general atrophies. Apathy comes, followed by depression. Dog

              surrenders and closes from the world. This is called learned helplessness.

              <br> <br>

              How to help your dog come out of learned helplessness:

              <br> <br>

              ✅ Remedy 1: Help the dog do something. Seriously: whatever. Offer the dog a game -

              scatter

              attractive objects and food across the floor. And now it is necessary to praise and encourage the dog very much for any

              act. She got up - well done, sat down - great, sniffed something - super well done! I looked at something -

              clever.

              Made a step - super dog! She took the object in her mouth - there is no limit to joy. First, the dog has

              appears

              choice: to do this or that. Secondly, in a situation of choice, she can make a decision and immediately

              execute. In this game, the dog makes his own personal decision and it always brings

              positive

              result! So even a small action becomes a vaccine against turning into a vegetable.

              <br> <br>

              ✅ Remedy 2: Away from helplessness - in small steps.

              Ideas about myself "I can't do anything", "I'm worthless", "my attempts won't change anything"

              are composed of individual cases. If the dog is defeated too often, it develops a low

              self-esteem, the dog gives up.

              The good news is that your dog's beliefs can also be changed. Small achievements help

              gain resources for more ambitious actions. Small victories give the dog confidence in his

              forces.

              String new experiences like beads on a fishing line. Step over the 10 cm high barrier, put your paws on

              an unusual surface, come one step closer to a frightening object, solve a simple puzzle,

              execute

              the simplest command - for everything the dog receives a sea of ​​praise and goodies. Over time from individual parts

              you will get a necklace - a new idea of ​​the dog about itself: “I succeed”, “My actions bring

              positive result ”,“ I can influence my life ”.

            <summary> Flea Tar Soap for Dogs? </summary>

            <p> Pets often have "uninvited guests" on their skin. Parasites inflict on the body

              pets are extremely harmful and can provoke a number of skin diseases. Therefore, we must get rid of them. But

              not

              less harm to the health of the dog and a variety of antiparasitic agents that contain

              harsh chemicals. Some owners, knowing this, try to eliminate fleas with

              ordinary tar soap. Let's find out in detail about this.

              <br> <br>

              About the benefits of a hygiene product

              First of all, we note that it does not completely destroy the parasites, but only scares them away. The product has

              one biggest drawback: it smells bad. It is the "aroma" of tar soap that is

              a property that scares away "uninvited guests". It kind of warns insects that the dog's blood

              becomes unusable.

              Alkali and phenol as components of the product burn the body of various microbes, causing clotting

              proteins.

              After cleaning the skin of the animal with tar soap, microbes die completely, and fleas, moving chaotically and

              sluggish

              gradually retreat. The above substances do not kill blood-sucking insects, because their body is protected

              shell. Also, the active ingredients do not remove flea eggs on the dog's coat. But birch

              tar containing benzene paralyzes the nerve nodes of fleas, so they cannot actively move, which

              allows the owner to gradually comb them out of the wool. Alkali and phenol protect the top layer of the skin

              animal from moisture loss.

              <br> <br>

              Can I wash my dog ​​with tar soap?

              This inexpensive remedy has so many useful qualities that specialized drugs to combat

              parasites cannot compete. Skin surface treatment with this product

              absolutely

              safe for the health of not only healthy individuals, but also small puppies and pregnant bitches. You can

              use on animals with abrasions and scratches, open wounds, eczema and dermatitis. Tar soap

              maintains the water-salt balance of the skin, while other antiparasitic agents dry out

              the upper layer of the epithelium. Unlike shampoos and various animal detergents, it can

              apply

              with the necessary consistency without any threat to the health of the pets.

              Among the possible negative consequences of using a hygiene product can only be

              lather in the eyes or nose of a pet. In this case, burning and irritation may disturb.

              If a small amount of foamy mass gets into the dog's mouth, it will not cause poisoning. Also

              possible individual intolerance to the pet soap ingredients based on tar.

              <br> <br>

              So you can wash your beloved dog with such a product without fear for his health.

              <br> <br>

              Bathing your pet correctly

              Prepare to do the bathing procedure twice. You will need: a fine comb and

              leash, terry towels, dishes for foaming raw materials, high capacity for blood-sucking insects.

              So,

              proceed in this order:

              <br> <br>

              Fill a bowl with warm water, dip in ½ bar of crushed soap, foam the solution.

              Place a second piece of food on the bottom of a tall container to soften it.

              Place your dog in a deep bowl or bath.

              Wet her fur thoroughly, including her armpits.

              Douse the animal with the soap suds solution. Massage the coat. Rub thoroughly with soaked soap

              Keep your pet soaped up for at least five minutes. Figure out how you can keep your

              If the dog is calm, start combing out the weakened parasites with a comb and place them in a high container.

            <summary> Ticks in Dogs </summary>

            <p>

              The tick activity season has arrived. And the risks of infection with babesiosis (piroplasmosis) of our

              tetrapods

              friends. Carried by ticks.

              <br> <br>

              Depending on the size, age and state of immunity of the dog, the period of development of piroplasmosis lasts

              several days to three weeks.

              The main factors affecting the length of the incubation period:

              <br> <br>

              Weakened and young animals fall ill faster and carry the disease more severely;

              <br> <br>

              The duration of the presence of the tick in the wound. If you remove the sucked tick no later than 48, the risks of infection

              are significantly reduced.

              <br> <br>

              The incubation period increases if the dog has previously suffered from piroplasmosis, or has been vaccinated with a vaccine,

              or

              was born in an area where this disease is common (Siberia, the Far East)

              <br> <br>

              Signs of piroplasmosis in dogs:

              <br> <br>

              General weakness, lethargy

              Temperature rise to 40 - 42 degrees

              Dark, almost black urine, or red urine (a sign of kidney damage)

              Mucous membranes are pale

              <br> <br>

              Piroplasmosis is often accompanied by diarrhea and vomiting, sometimes with blood

              Difficulty moving, convulsions, paralysis of the limbs.

              <br> <br>

              In the early stages, dog owners are not very worried and do not go to the veterinary clinic. Deceit

              the disease consists in the fact that after a few days the dog gets better, but on the 6-7th day it is possible

              sudden death of the animal.

              <br> <br>

              In the absence of treatment, the dog's condition deteriorates significantly, it refuses food, urine

              takes on a dark, greenish-brown color, up to black.

              <br> <br>

              Urine coloration is the most striking symptom of piroplasmosis in dogs, but in the summer, when infection occurs,

              owners rarely see a change in the color of urine, therefore, the appeal to the veterinarian is delayed.

              <br> <br>

              ‼ ️ Without timely treatment, mortality among dogs from piroplasmosis reaches 98%.

              <br> <br>

              Prevention of piroplasmosis in dogs.

              <br> <br>

              We choose one thing:

              1.Treating a dog with a spray, drops that protect against ticks and fleas

              2. Using similar collars according to the scheme described in the instructions

              3.Oral drugs (tablets)

              Today there is a large selection of drugs for every budget.

              <br> <br>

              Recently, dog owners have begun using a vaccine against this disease.

              <br> <br>

              Features of vaccinations against piroplasmosis for dogs

              <br> <br>

              There are vaccines: Pirodog and Nobivak Piro, they contain isolated antigens of piroplasmas.

              <br> <br>

              Unlike many vaccines, Pirodog and Nobivak Piro vaccines against piroplasmosis for dogs help produce

              weak immunity, their main task is to reduce the number of deaths from a dog's disease.

              <br> <br>

              🆘 What if the tick has already sucked?

              <br> <br>

              Use tweezers or special tools (sold in veterinary stores) to gently unscrew the tick. Not

              pull so as not to tear off the tick's head.

              <br> <br>

              If the tick body still comes off, do not panic, but pull out the head with a sterile object (

              needles, for example) in a way as if pulling out a splinter. After removing the tick's head, we treat the wound

              chlorhexidine or other disinfectant.

              <br> <br>

              On the Internet, you can find ways to extract a tick, such as lubricating with oil, alcohol, etc. and

              the tick will come out by itself.

              <br> <br>

              NO! Will not come out.

              <br> <br>

              Don't waste precious time. Remember that infection occurs through the tick's salivary glands and does not

              immediately after the bite. It is important to remove the tick from the dog as early as possible, preferably no later than 48 hours, as

              the risks of infection are significantly reduced.

              <br> <br>

              We observe closely the dog after the tick has been removed.

              If the general condition of the dog worsens, one or more external signs of the disease appear, jogging

              to

              to the doctor.

            <summary> Puppy socialization periods! </summary>

 

            <p> This topic will be relevant not only for puppy owners, but also for owners of adult dogs, perhaps

              after reading, you will understand where your dog's problems may have come from.

              <br> <br>

              There are different opinions about socialization, experts tell information in different ways. If

              summarize,

              then socialization is a puppy's acquaintance with the world and canine society, the more he learns and sees in the world

              safe and without negative experience, the more comfortable you will be with it in the environment. In

              in adulthood, the dog can be introduced to something unfamiliar to her, however, it will be more difficult

              process,

              since the animal may have fear and excessive caution. Also, the less the dog saw and

              learned

              in this world, the more difficult it is for her to expand the "knowledge base" about what surrounds her. Little puppy pretty

              open

              to knowledge, to acquaintances and building relationships, the baby captures phenomena that are safe for himself and

              objects,

              as he grows up, he becomes more careful and neat. Socialization is a rather lengthy process, but

              skipping the first stages gives serious complications in the development of fears, hyperactivity, weakening of the nervous

              systems. A puppy raised in an impoverished environment, in poor conditions and with few social contacts

              similar to "Mowgli", the world scares him, so the aggression of fear can be formed as well.

              <br> <br>

              I decided to prepare this material based on research, namely, on different classifications. I.e,

              you

              you can familiarize yourself with information on this matter. And I sincerely hope that you will be interested and

              informative. I admit, the material came out not easy. I provide links to scientific works and quotes from them, you

              you can fully familiarize yourself with them.

              <br> <br>

              Let's start with what socialization is. You can find these definitions in the concept

              socialization for people.

              <br> <br>

              Socialization is the process of integrating an individual into a social system, entering the social environment through

              mastering her social norms, rules and values, knowledge, skills that allow him to successfully

              function in society.

              <br> <br>

              Let's remember the word integration here.

              <br> <br>

              Social maturity

              In wild relatives of dogs, sexual maturity occurs simultaneously with social maturity, namely at 12-18 months,

              when there is the formation of persistent hierarchical relationships and the emergence of such behaviors as

              aggression and protection of the territory. At the same age, the domestic dog often shows aggression towards

              and

              to owners, and to strangers (Bradshaw, Brown, 1990).

              Thus, we see that social maturity occurs approximately by the year. From this you can do

              important conclusion: after a year (or a little longer) dogs can no longer socialize, they go through the process

              adaptation, so what they like to call socialization of a dog from a shelter is actually called

              adaptation outside the critical periods of socialization is not possible.

              <br> <br>

              Adaptation (from Lat. Adaptare - to adapt) - in a broad sense - adaptation to changing external and

              internal conditions

              In my article, I focus on works:

              <br> <br>

              - Mychko E.N., Sotskaya M.N. Socialization

              <br> <br>

              - K. Shepherd Behavioral Development, Social Behavior and Communication in Dogs

              <br> <br>

              - V.V. Gritsenko Training for beginners also pays attention to the concept of socialization and scientific

              research on this topic

              <br> <br>

              - D. Scott and D. Fuller Genetics and Social Behavior of the Dog (in English)

              <br> <br>

              Mychko and Sotskaya distinguish critical periods of socialization in their work. We also get acquainted with the concept

              socialization in their work:

              <br> <br>

              Socialization is understood as a multi-stage process during which the personality of a social

              animal, and connections with its environment are formed. Each stage of socialization is limited in time and has

              critical terms when congenital behavioral programs are turned on and completed through acquisition

              new conditioned reflexes, which are brought to perfection by gradual training. This process goes on

              all behavioral levels: new needs and innate components of motivation are included. Animal

              catches the basic laws and causal relationships of the surrounding world, the understanding of which to him

              necessary at this stage of development. If the stage is not completed for some reason (hereditary program

              turned on,

              but not completely completed), all further development of the dog as a social animal turns out to be

              defective, mentally disturbed, behavior abnormal.

              The authors note that it is quite difficult to designate clear periods, since different breeds may have

              differences. There are three periods of socialization, I will summarize the basic information, there are links above where you

              you can read the research in more detail.

              <br> <br>

              The first period of socialization

              Approximately 2 to 8 weeks.

              <br> <br>

              Includes: one of the most important events in the life of a social animal is imprinting, during which

              the image of one's own species is captured and - this is a feature of the dog - the image of a human partner; the rise of two

              complex behavioral complexes: play and research inextricably linked with it, is formed

              the concept of "WE".

              <br> <br>

              Second period of socialization

              from 1.5 to 5 months.

              <br> <br>

              Includes: The essence of the period in the formation of personality, that the puppy acquires its own "I",

              research activity is increasing, the concept of "strangers" does not yet exist.

              <br> <br>

              Third period of socialization

              6-10 months and is directly related to actively proceeding puberty

              <br> <br>

              Includes: the dog is included in the structure of the pack, stranger dogs can already show aggression towards

              teenager

              the social environment is shrinking. The essence of the third period is that the dog divides the world on the basis of "his" and

              "strangers", "THEY" is added to the concepts of "WE" and "I".

              <br> <br>

              Based on these periods, we can summarize that socialization (integration into society) lasts up to 10-12

              months. Mychko and Sotskaya also identify the psychophysiological stages of puppy development (postnatal,

              neonatal, transitional, period of primary socialization, juvenile, puberty). More about

              Tom,

              how these scientists describe these periods in their works, you can get acquainted in their works.

              <br> <br>

              For further comparison, it is important to consider that they distinguish these periods.

              <br> <br>

              In particular, note that the period of primary socialization lasts from 35-80 days. Many authors

              and

              specialists, you can find the following information on the topic of such socialization:

              <br> <br>

              - Up to 3-3.5 months, the most important period of socialization

              <br> <br>

              - Some experts believe that socialization occurs only up to 3-3.5 months, the rest of the time

              the whole process should be called adaptation.

              <br> <br>

              I am an adherent of the first statement, but it is because of the second opinion that you can read this article. To me

              I wanted to understand for myself on the basis of what materials the experts claim this. I found out that some

              experts refer to the works of Scott and Fuller. Next, I'll tell you about their classification.

              <br> <br>

              Neonatal period

              This period begins from the moment of birth. The puppy does not orientate itself, tries to support

              contact with the mother and other puppies. During this period, the puppy gets to know the environment through the body.

              (crawling, warmth, cold, pain). The puppy learns to eat, it is necessary to crawl to the mother's nipple, crumple with its paws

              mom to get milk. Fuller and Scott point out that puppies do poorly during this period, and this

              the period is characterized by receiving food.

              <br> <br>

              Transition period

              Roughly the period starts from 13 days (from the moment the eyes are opened, but it can vary in different

              rocks).

              This period is highly adaptive. During this period, the puppy begins to receive information about the world through sight and

              hearing, learn to walk and explore the environment, begin to eat not only milk, but also soft

              food,

              relations with the mother are already being built on a more complex level, the first social relations are being formed.

              <br> <br>

              Socialization period

              The same period of socialization that we saw earlier in Mychko and Sotskaya.

              <br> <br>

              Roughly 3 weeks to 12 weeks. This is a period of active development of social patterns of behavior.

              Mostly they are associated with the mother and littermates. In the period of socialization, the puppy plays out the adults

              behavioral models. Relationships with humans and with other puppies are easy to develop. The first

              reaction to a stranger. As the puppy gets older, fear and flight become reactions.

              Therefore, this is a critical period for the formation of social relations.

              <br> <br>

              The period is extremely important in the formation of social skills.

              <br> <br>

              Juvenile period

              From 12 weeks to puberty.

              <br> <br>

              In this period, the main development is associated with the maturation of motor abilities. The period ends for

              maturation of sexual abilities, that is, the ability to have sexual intercourse.

              <br> <br>

              The socialization period according to Scott and Fuller's classification ends when the puppy reaches an age of about

              three months. Then the juvenile period begins (in other classifications, the period of socialization and

              neonatal

              can combine and call the "period of socialization with relatives"). During the juvenile period, the puppy

              continues to develop communication skills, learns the "language" of its kind. This is an important age for meeting people.

              of different ages, height and appearance, with peculiarities of gait, as well as with dogs of different breeds. If the puppy

              spend the juvenile period outside the city, then in a tense and stimulating urban environment he will

              behave cowardly. This is exactly the same for dogs from the shelter, and for "safe" dogs from

              country nursery.

              New life for a stray dog. Sofia Baskina, Oksana Dubinina

              From this passage we can conclude that the period called "socialization" ends at 3 months, but

              myself

              the process of socialization and integration into society continues in the juvenile period.

              <br> <br>

              Fuller and Scott talk about significant differences in socialization outcomes and social model building

              behavior, if they started at 14 weeks of age, outside the period of socialization, the results were

              much worse.

              <br> <br>

              Summing up, we can identify important points for ourselves:

              - The process of socialization ends before a year (in the process of puberty, the period ends

              socialization)

              <br> <br>

              - The period of socialization in the classification of Scott and Fuller ends at 3 months. This period is called

              critical period

              <br> <br>

              - Animals that did not receive proper experience in the period before the end of the socialization period (12 weeks), in

              subsequently, they may have difficulties in integrating with society, problems in communicating with relatives and people

              <br> <br>

              - After 3 months, you need to continue to engage in the development of the dog, its socialization (integration into the environment)

              <br> <br>

              - The puppy needs to be socialized as early as possible, otherwise you are wasting valuable time

              1) Give him what he needs - toys to chew on, games in which he can run and bark.

              Not

              overdo it. Play for 5 minutes, then give the puppy the toy and do not do it for 10 minutes, then

              again.

              This is especially important with excitable dogs. If you play toys with them until the puppy falls off

              from

              legs, he can turn into a "ball-grabbing maniac." This is undesirable for a companion dog. On the contrary

              -

              a dog for sports, with this you need to play a lot and varied.

              <br> <br>

              2) Train your puppy to use a soft collar from the very first days. To do this, leave the collar on the puppy several

              hours. If the puppy is very actively trying to get rid of the collar, it itches, wear the collar during the games

              or

              feeding so he can get distracted and get used to the collar. !!! At night and when you leave home,

              be sure to remove the collar from the dog !!!

              <br> <br>

              As soon as the puppy is accustomed to the collar, attach a meter leash to it or tie a rope like this

              the same length. With this string, the puppy will walk all week (!!! at night and when the puppy is left alone - all

              always remove from it !!!). The first day he will gnaw the rope (if he gnaws, just tie it

              ends), will step on and stumble over it - it's okay. By the third day he will forget about the string.

              <br> <br>

              * If the puppy grabs your hand, take the end of the leash and say "No!" Don't pull his hand from him

              iso

              mouth, but just hold the leash. As soon as you let go of your hand, say: "Excellent!" If the puppy has lost

              interest in your hands - let go of the leash. If he plays out - hold him by the leash at an outstretched

              hand,

              so that he can stand with all four paws on the floor, but he cannot grab your hand or clothing. If he

              jumps, you can slightly pull the leash to the side to make the puppy lose his balance in the jump and hurry

              stand on four paws.

              <br> <br>

              Be patient - it may take a while for your puppy to calm down and stop.

              "Predatory" tricks at first. Gradually he will get used to it and will immediately react to the ban and

              leash.

              <br> <br>

              * If the puppy starts to gnaw the legs of the chair - immediately say "No!" and pull it back by the leash. Wait

              until

              he will get up on all four legs, stop reaching for the chair leg and, preferably, look at you. Tell

              "well done!" and give him something to chew on.

              <br> <br>

              * If the puppy grabbed a sock and started running around the apartment with it, inviting you to join, step on

              end of the leash, then pull the puppy towards you by the leash (do not come up yourself!) and carefully pull out the sock

              at

              from his mouth.

              <br> <br>

              If you do this all the time, hold the puppy by the leash to prevent

              to do

              something inappropriate, then he will not form unwanted habits: he will not bite your hands,

              having played out, will not steal socks or shoes, and gnaw furniture. Leave the leash on the puppy for one week

              (only in your presence !!!), if he is still hooligan - the second. Later, months later, sometimes

              has to

              return to the leash for an hour or two, rarely longer.

              <br> <br>

              It is easy to learn how to use this technique and prevent unwanted behavior from developing. However

              some

              the hosts still make mistakes:

              1) A leash is not a panacea. Hold and release, do not lead your puppy on a leash all day long.

              2) Control the puppy by the leash, do not grab it by the collar, and even more so by the scruff. By this you either

              scare

              puppy (which can lead to fear aggression), or provoke game aggression (you grabbed - he bit

              -

              you pulled your hand back - he bit again).

              3) In no case during the first week of the puppy's stay in the house, do not yell at him, do not beat him, do not

              punish

              ignoring and do not shake by the scruff, do not press to the floor, do not turn onto your back.

              <br> <br>

              Everything is in vogue, even cruelty, which illiterate dog owners and trainers explain

              ostensibly

              dominance theory (and having no idea what it is). They don't even have enough knowledge to appreciate

              the results of their erroneous ideas. Nevertheless, on forums, on sites, in the yard and from books, you

              you will hear: shake by the scruff, press to the floor. So I will repeat it again in large letters:

              <br> <br>

              In no case during the first week of the puppy's stay in the house, do not yell at him, do not beat him, do not punish

              ignoring and do not shake by the scruff, do not press to the floor, do not turn onto your back.
